    Please provide a summary for the teacher. The summary should be:
    1.  **Concise (1-3 paragraphs):** Get straight to the point.
    2.  **Teacher-Focused:** Use professional language suitable for an educator.
    3.  **Highlights Key Learning:** What was the main math topic? What concepts were introduced or reviewed?
    4.  **Student's Engagement/Understanding:** How did the student perform? Were they engaged? Did they grasp the concepts? What were their specific areas of difficulty or success? (e.g., "struggled with finding common denominators," "demonstrated strong understanding of cross-multiplication").
    5.  **Suggestions for Next Steps:** Provide 1-3 concrete, actionable suggestions for the teacher to continue supporting the student's learning, building on this session. These could be:
        * Practice specific problem types.
        * Review a particular concept.
        * Consider specific scaffolding strategies.
        * Refer to IEP goals if relevant to the session.

    Format your response clearly with a "Summary:" section and a "Next Steps:" section.
