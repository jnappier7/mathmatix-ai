  "overview": "A mini-course for parents of 6th through 8th graders. Middle school math introduces powerful visual and conceptual tools—ratio tables, double number lines, algebra tiles, and integer chips—that may look completely foreign. Meanwhile, your child is learning to think algebraically, reason proportionally, and work with negative numbers in ways that go far beyond 'just follow the rules.' This course helps you understand and support these methods.",
  "prerequisites": [],
  "naturalProgression": [
    "Start with ratios and proportional reasoning—ratio tables, double number lines, and unit rates that replace cross-multiplication with real understanding (Unit 1)",
    "Explore how algebra tiles and visual balance models make solving equations concrete before it becomes abstract (Unit 2)",
    "Understand the integer and rational number strategies—number lines, chip models, and real-world contexts—that replace 'two negatives make a positive' with genuine comprehension (Unit 3)",
    "Decode the geometry and statistics tools—transformations, the coordinate plane, and data displays—that prepare your child for high school math (Unit 4)"

  "aiGuidanceNotes": "Middle school parents face a double challenge: the math methods are unfamiliar AND their child is becoming more independent (and possibly resistant to help). Acknowledge both realities. For ratios, the biggest shift is from cross-multiplication as a trick to proportional reasoning as a way of thinking. For algebra, reassure parents that tiles and balance models are temporary scaffolds—the abstract equation solving they remember IS still the goal. For integers, the pattern approach to explaining why negative × negative = positive is the most powerful tool. Throughout, help parents understand that their role is shifting from 'do the homework with them' to 'ask good questions and show interest.' Give specific conversation starters they can use with their middle schooler."
