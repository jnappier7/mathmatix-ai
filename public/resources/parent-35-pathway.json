  "courseType": "mini-course",
  "overview": "A mini-course for parents of 3rd through 5th graders. As multiplication, division, and fractions take center stage, the methods your child learns may look nothing like what you remember. Area models replace long multiplication, partial products break big problems into manageable pieces, and fraction operations use visual models before rules. This course demystifies these approaches so you can help with confidence—not confusion.",
  "prerequisites": [],
  "naturalProgression": [
    "Begin with area models and partial products for multiplication—the methods that replace the traditional algorithm your child's teacher may delay until 5th grade (Unit 1)",
    "Explore division strategies including partial quotients and the 'big 7' method that build understanding before the standard long division algorithm (Unit 2)",
    "Understand the visual fraction revolution: fraction bars, number lines, and area models that make 'common denominator' rules actually make sense (Unit 3)",
    "Decode the word problem strategies—tape diagrams, strip models, and multi-step problem solving—that are the hallmark of modern elementary math (Unit 4)"

    "approach": "Parent-focused conversational learning",

Each lesson explains WHAT the method is, HOW it works with step-by-step examples, and WHY modern math teaches it this way. Side-by-side comparisons with traditional algorithms are used throughout. The AI validates parents' existing knowledge while showing them the reasoning behind newer approaches.",

The traditional algorithms (stacking multiplication, long division) are deeply ingrained from their own schooling, and seeing their child use unfamiliar methods can feel alarming. Always lead with empathy: 'The way you learned is correct—your child is learning a method that builds the same skills with more understanding built in.' Area models and partial products are the #1 source of parent confusion—spend extra time there. For fractions, validate that 'find a common denominator' is still the end goal, and show how visuals are the path to that rule, not a replacement for it."
