  "overview": "A 36-week Common Core 6th grade math course covering the full 6.NS / 6.RP / 6.EE / 6.G / 6.SP standards. Starts with a diagnostic boot camp to repair 5th-grade gaps, then builds through number system fluency, ratios and rates, expressions and equations, geometry, statistics, integers, and ends with an applied number sense bridge to pre-algebra. Every skill is spiraled all year so nothing vanishes.",

    "Write, evaluate, and simplify algebraic expressions using properties",
    "Solve one-step and two-step equations and inequalities from context",
    "Calculate area, surface area, and volume of 2D and 3D figures",

Fraction fluency is the #1 predictor of 6th-grade success — if a student can't add fractions or divide decimals fluently, every subsequent unit will struggle. Use real-world contexts constantly (money, cooking, sports, gaming) to make abstract concepts stick for 11-12 year olds. When teaching expressions and equations, emphasize the REASONING behind inverse operations, not just procedural steps."
