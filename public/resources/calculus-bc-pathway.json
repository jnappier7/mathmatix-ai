  "overview": "A 36-week AP Calculus BC course aligned to the College Board CED (2020). Covers all AB topics plus parametric/polar/vector-valued functions and infinite sequences & series. Built on an 11-unit scope and sequence (Units 0–10) with two heavyweight units (Integration 17–20%, Series 17–18%) receiving proportionally more instructional time. Every unit integrates calculator-active and no-calculator practice, FRQ-style justification writing, and graphical/tabular interpretation. Spiral review threads run through every checkpoint.",
  "prerequisites": ["precalculus"],
  "naturalProgression": [
    "Begin with Prereq Patch (Unit 0) to diagnose and repair algebra, trig, and function gaps that derail calculus learning",
    "Establish the concept of limits and continuity (Unit 1) as the foundation for the derivative",
    "Define the derivative through the difference quotient and build basic differentiation rules (Unit 2)",
    "Extend differentiation to composite, implicit, and inverse functions via chain rule (Unit 3)",
    "Apply differentiation to real-world contexts: related rates, motion, linearization, L'Hôpital (Unit 4)",
    "Analyze functions using first/second derivative tests, concavity, EVT/MVT, and optimization (Unit 5)",
    "Build the integral from Riemann sums through FTC Parts 1 & 2, antiderivatives, and accumulation functions (Unit 6 — heavyweight)",
    "Solve differential equations via separation of variables and slope fields (Unit 7)",
    "Apply integration to area, volume (disk/washer/cross-section), average value, and motion (Unit 8)",
    "Extend to parametric, polar, and vector-valued functions with derivatives and integrals (Unit 9 — BC-exclusive)",
    "Master infinite sequences and series, convergence tests, Taylor/Maclaurin polynomials, and error bounds (Unit 10 — heavyweight, BC-exclusive)",
    "Synthesize all skills through comprehensive AP exam-format review and final assessment (Final Review)"

    "Justification writing — FRQ-style reasoning practiced weekly: 'because f' changes sign' not just 'the function has a max'",
    "Calculator competence — calculator-active and no-calculator skills explicitly practiced; students learn when to use and when not to use technology",
    "Connections across representations — numerical, graphical, algebraic, and verbal representations linked throughout"
