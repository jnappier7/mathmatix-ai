  "overview": "A 36-week AP Calculus AB course built on a 10-unit scope and sequence aligned to the College Board CED. Covers limits, derivatives, integrals, differential equations, and their applications through the gradual release instruction model. Opens with a targeted algebra/precalc bootcamp ('Don't Let Algebra Murder Calculus'), then systematically builds through all eight AP units plus a comprehensive review cycle. Weekly rhythm integrates FRQ practice, no-calculator drills, and spiral retrieval from Day 1.",

    "Launch with a targeted algebra/precalc bootcamp (Unit 0) — patch function behavior, rational functions, exponent/log rules, trig fluency, and graph reading. NOT a full precalc review, just what will immediately break limits and derivatives.",
    "Build the foundation of calculus with limits and continuity (Unit 1): limits from graphs/tables/algebra, one-sided and infinite limits, limits at infinity, continuity, IVT, and squeeze theorem.",
    "Define the derivative and establish basic rules (Unit 2): difference quotient, derivative as rate of change, differentiability vs. continuity, power/product/quotient rules, common derivatives, and derivatives from graphs/tables.",
    "Extend differentiation to composite, implicit, and inverse functions (Unit 3): chain rule, implicit differentiation, inverse function derivatives, inverse trig derivatives, and higher-order derivatives.",
    "Apply differentiation in context (Unit 4): related rates, motion (position/velocity/acceleration), local linearization, differentials, and L'Hôpital's Rule.",
    "Develop analytical applications of differentiation (Unit 5): MVT/EVT, increasing/decreasing behavior, extrema, concavity/inflection, first and second derivative tests, candidates test, curve sketching, and optimization.",
    "Master integration and accumulation of change (Unit 6): definite integral as accumulation, Riemann sums, FTC Parts 1 and 2, antiderivatives, indefinite integrals, properties of integrals, and basic techniques.",
    "Explore differential equations (Unit 7): slope fields, separable DEs, general and particular solutions, and exponential growth/decay models.",
    "Apply integration (Unit 8): average value, motion via integrals, net change, area between curves, and volume by cross-sections and disk/washer methods.",
    "Synthesize all skills through cumulative review with timed MCQ sets, timed FRQs, and error analysis (Unit 9)."
