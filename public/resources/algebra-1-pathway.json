  "overview": "A full-year Algebra 1 course that builds abstract mathematical thinking from concrete foundations. Students progress from variable fluency and equation-solving through linear and quadratic functions, systems of equations, polynomial operations, data analysis, and exponential models. Every unit connects algebra to real-world contexts—budgets, motion, growth, and measurement—so students see why these tools matter.",
  "prerequisites": ["grade-8"],
  "naturalProgression": [
    "Begin with the language of algebra: variables, expressions, order of operations, and properties that govern how numbers combine (Unit 1)",
    "Build equation-solving fluency from one-step through multi-step equations, literal equations, and inequalities—the core skill of the course (Unit 2)",
    "Transition from solving equations to understanding functions: domain, range, slope, intercept forms, and graphing linear relationships (Unit 3)",
    "Extend linear thinking to systems of two equations using graphing, substitution, and elimination, with real-world applications like break-even analysis (Unit 4)",
    "Develop polynomial fluency through exponent rules, polynomial operations, factoring GCF, trinomials, and special patterns (Unit 5)",
    "Explore quadratic functions—graphing parabolas, solving by factoring, square roots, completing the square, and the quadratic formula (Unit 6)",
    "Apply algebraic reasoning to data: measures of central tendency, scatter plots, lines of best fit, and introductory probability (Unit 7)",
    "Model real-world growth and decay with exponential functions, comparing linear vs exponential change (Unit 8)",
    "Work with rational expressions: simplifying, multiplying, dividing, and solving rational equations with extraneous-solution awareness (Unit 9)",
    "Synthesize algebra and geometry through radical operations, the Pythagorean theorem, distance formula, and geometric applications (Unit 10)"

    "Algebraic manipulation — distributing, combining like terms, and factoring revisited with increasing complexity across polynomials, quadratics, and rationals",
    "Real-world modeling — translating word problems into algebraic models practiced in every unit context (cost, motion, growth, measurement)",

Equation-solving fluency should be the first priority—students who can confidently solve equations will succeed in every subsequent unit. Linear functions connect algebra to visual reasoning through graphing; always use multiple representations (table, graph, equation, verbal). Factoring requires significant practice—build it gradually with GCF before trinomials. The quadratic formula is a powerful safety net, but encourage understanding factoring and completing the square first so students develop algebraic intuition. For struggling students, spiral back to equation-solving fundamentals. For advanced students, push toward modeling and real-world application projects."
