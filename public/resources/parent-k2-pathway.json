  "audience": "parent",
  "courseType": "mini-course",
  "overview": "A mini-course designed for parents of Kindergarten through 2nd grade students. Today's early math classrooms emphasize number sense and flexible thinking over rote memorization. This course walks you through the strategies your child is learning—number bonds, ten frames, making ten, counting on, and more—so you can understand the 'what,' 'how,' and 'why' behind each method and confidently support homework time at home.",
  "prerequisites": [],
  "naturalProgression": [
    "Start with number bonds and decomposing numbers—the foundation of how modern K–2 math builds number sense (Unit 1)",
    "Explore ten frames and the 'making ten' strategy that replaces traditional carrying with deep place value understanding (Unit 2)",
    "Learn the counting-on and counting-back strategies that build mental math fluency without finger-counting dependency (Unit 3)",
    "Understand how visual models—bar models, part-whole diagrams, and number lines—give kids a concrete bridge to abstract math (Unit 4)"
  ],
  "aiInstructionModel": {
    "approach": "Parent-focused conversational learning",
    "description": "The AI teaches parents as adult learners using a conversational, reassuring tone. Each lesson explains WHAT the method is, HOW it works with step-by-step examples, and WHY modern math teaches it this way (the research and reasoning). The AI uses side-by-side comparisons with traditional methods parents remember, validates that the traditional way still 'works,' and shows how the new approach builds deeper understanding. Parents are encouraged to try example problems themselves.",

Many parents feel frustrated or even embarrassed that they don't understand their child's math homework—acknowledge that feeling and normalize it. Always validate that the 'old way' works too, while explaining why the 'new way' builds deeper understanding. Use plenty of visual examples and side-by-side comparisons. Avoid education jargon unless you define it. The goal is confidence: parents should finish each lesson feeling equipped to help their child tonight."
