  "track": "Early Math Foundations (Grades 3–5)",
  "overview": "A foundational course targeting the essential Grades 3–5 skills that every student must own before middle school succeeds. Covers whole number operations (addition through long division), fraction concepts and operations, decimal fluency, basic geometry and measurement, data interpretation, and early algebraic thinking. Designed for students with elementary gaps — whether they're preparing for 6th grade, catching up mid-year, or building confidence. Diagnostic-first: find what's broken, fix it, prove it's fixed.",
  "prerequisites": [],
  "naturalProgression": [
    "Diagnose number sense gaps: place value, rounding, estimation, basic fact fluency",
    "Lock in multi-digit addition and subtraction with regrouping",
    "Build multiplication fluency through 12×12 and multi-digit multiplication",
    "Master division facts and long division with interpreting remainders",
    "Understand fractions as parts, equivalence, and comparison",
    "Add, subtract, and multiply fractions with unlike denominators",
    "Read, compare, and compute with decimals; connect to fractions",
    "Calculate perimeter, area, angles, and classify shapes",
    "Interpret graphs, extend patterns, and use unknowns",
    "Prove readiness for 6th-grade math with cumulative mastery"

    "description": "The AI tutor leads instruction using the CPA model — every concept starts with something you can touch or see (manipulatives, drawings, real objects), moves to pictures and diagrams (bar models, area models, number lines), then formalizes to numbers and symbols.

Never assume a student 'should' know something — if they don't, teach it without judgment. Use the CPA model rigorously: concrete objects first (blocks, coins, food), then pictures/diagrams, then symbols. Fact fluency (especially multiplication) is the single biggest lever — students who don't know their facts will struggle with fractions, division, and everything that follows. Be patient, be encouraging, and celebrate progress."
