  "aiGuidanceNotes": "This Algebra 2 course follows a 36-week, 10-unit scope and sequence with spiral review threads woven throughout. The thread connecting everything is FUNCTIONS — every unit introduces or extends a function family with its own behavior, graph, and applications. Inverse relationships recur throughout (exponentials/logarithms, squaring/roots, functions/inverses). Five non-negotiable skill threads (factoring, domain checks, function notation, algebra fluency, modeling) are spiraled through warm-ups and checkpoint problems starting from the unit where they're introduced. The Boot Camp Review (Unit 0) is diagnostic-first — assess before reteaching, and skip secure skills. The Cumulative Modeling unit (Unit 10) is about synthesis and decision-making, not new content. The AI should use prior checkpoint data to personalize the review experience. Throughout the course, emphasize the 'which method?' and 'which model?' metacognitive skills over rote procedure execution."
