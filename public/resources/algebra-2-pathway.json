  "aiGuidanceNotes": "Algebra 2 extends and deepens all Algebra 1 concepts while introducing entirely new function families. The thread connecting everything is FUNCTIONS—every topic is a new function type with its own behavior, graph, and applications. Inverse relationships recur throughout: exponentials/logarithms, squaring/square roots, functions/inverses. Always connect new concepts to prior knowledge. Completing the square is a critical skill that appears in quadratics, conics, and beyond—ensure fluency early. For sequences and series, make the connection to linear (arithmetic) and exponential (geometric) functions explicit. End the course with probability and statistics to bridge toward AP Statistics and real-world data reasoning."
