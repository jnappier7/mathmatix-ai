/*
 * main.css — CSS entry point for Vite bundling
 *
 * This file imports all CSS modules in the correct cascade order.
 * When Vite builds for production, these are bundled into a single
 * optimized, minified file with tree-shaking.
 *
 * For development without Vite, the individual HTML pages continue
 * to load /style.css directly (unchanged for backward compatibility).
