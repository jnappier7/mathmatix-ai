    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We disclose data only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**With Your School/Teacher:** If your account is associated with a school or assigned to a teacher, relevant education records (e.g., conversation summaries, IEP plan details, and progress data) may be shared with your assigned teacher or authorized school officials for legitimate educational purposes, as permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).</li>
      <li>**Service Providers:** We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, email delivery). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes for which we provide it.</li>
      <li>**AI Services:** For AI functionality, prompts containing your messages are sent to AI models (e.g., Google's Gemini). We anonymize prompts where possible.
