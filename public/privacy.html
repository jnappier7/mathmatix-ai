    <p>Last updated: May 31, 2025</p>

    <p>At M∆THM∆TIΧ AI, we respect your privacy and are deeply committed to protecting your personal data, especially as an educational service. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information submitted by users of our platform ("Service").</p>

    <h2>1. What Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide and improve our Service. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Account Information:** Name (first, last), username, email address, and password hash (stored securely).</li>
      <li>**Educational Profile Data:** Grade level, current math course, learning style preferences, tone preferences, and interests.</li>
      <li>**Educational Records:** Your messages and interactions with the AI tutor (conversation history and content), AI-generated conversation summaries, and Individualized Education Program (IEP) plan details (accommodations, goals).</li>
      <li>**Gamification Data:** Experience points (XP), level, and active tutoring minutes.</li>
      <li>**Technical Data:** Limited technical data such as IP address (for security and anti-abuse purposes), device information, and browser type, collected automatically when you access the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data solely for educational purposes and to enhance your learning experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the Service, including managing your account and delivering tutoring.</li>
      <li>To personalize your learning experience, including tailoring AI responses based on your learning style, tone preference, and IEP accommodations.</li>
      <li>To store and provide access to your session history and summaries for your review and for your assigned teacher (if applicable).</li>
      <li>To improve tutoring responses and the overall Service over time, by analyzing aggregated and anonymized usage data.</li>
      <li>To track your progress, XP, and level for gamification purposes.</li>
      <li>For security and anti-abuse purposes, to protect our Service and other users.</li>
      <li>To communicate with you regarding Service updates or support inquiries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share and Disclose Your Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We disclose data only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**With Your School/Teacher:** If your account is associated with a school or assigned to a teacher, relevant education records (e.g., conversation summaries, IEP plan details, and progress data) may be shared with your assigned teacher or authorized school officials for legitimate educational purposes, as permitted by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).</li>
      <li>**Service Providers:** We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, email delivery). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the purposes for which we provide it.</li>
      <li>**AI Services:** For AI functionality, prompts containing your messages are sent to AI models (e.g., Google's Gemini). We anonymize prompts where possible. These AI services are contractually bound not to train their models on your personal identifiable information or to retain your personal messages.</li>
      <li>**Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
      <li>**Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction, provided that the new entity agrees to adhere to this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy (COPPA & FERPA)</h2>
    <p>M∆THM∆TIΧ AI is designed for educational use, including by children. We are committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for student data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For users under the age of 13, we require verifiable parental consent or consent provided by a school, as permitted by COPPA.</li>
      <li>When schools use the Service, we act as a "school official" under FERPA, processing education records solely for authorized educational purposes as defined by our agreements with the school.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights Regarding Your Data</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>**Access and Review:** You (or your parent/guardian) may request to inspect and review your education records by contacting us.</li>
      <li>**Amendment:** You may request that we amend records that you believe are inaccurate or misleading.</li>

      <li>**Data Portability:** You may request a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security practices to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Encryption:** Data is encrypted both in transit (using SSL/TLS) and at rest (storage-level encryption where feasible).</li>
      <li>**Access Controls:** Strict access controls and role-based permissions limit access to your data only to authorized personnel who need it for their job functions.</li>
      <li>**Secure Session Handling:** We utilize secure session management practices to protect your login sessions.</li>
      <li>**Regular Security Audits:** We regularly review our security practices and update them as necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
