Bring down 1. 1(\u22123)=\u22123, 2+(\u22123)=\u22121. \u22121(\u22123)=3, \u22121+3=2. 2(\u22123)=\u22126, 6+(\u22126)=0. Remainder = 0, so (x+3) IS a factor \u2192 hole at x = \u22123, NOT a VA. g(x) = x\u00b2 \u2212 x + 2, x \u2260 \u22123. This is a parabola with a hole at x = \u22123, y = 9+3+2 = 14, hole at (\u22123, 14). No VA, no HA, no oblique asymptote (the function reduces to a polynomial)."
