      "text": "When you see a proportion like 'If 3 apples cost $2, how much do 12 apples cost?', you probably set up:\n\n3/2 = 12/x → 3x = 24 → x = $8\n\nQuick, efficient, and it works. But your child might solve it like this:\n\n**Ratio Table:**\n```\nApples │ Cost\n───────┼──────\n   3   │  $2\n   6   │  $4    (×2)\n  12   │  $8    (×2)\n```\n\nOr they might use a **double number line:**\n```\nApples:  0────3────6────9────12\n         │    │    │    │    │\nCost:    0──$2──$4──$6──$8\n```\n\nBoth methods give $8. But there's a crucial difference: cross-multiplication is a TRICK that happens to work. Ratio tables and double number lines show WHY the relationship holds—because doubling the apples doubles the cost. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThis proportional reasoning—understanding that the relationship scales consistently—is the most important mathematical idea your child will learn in middle school. It's the foundation of algebra, geometry, statistics, and even science.",

Or we can scale up step by step. The ratio table makes the proportional relationship visible.\n\n**Bonus insight:** The unit rate (flour per cup of sugar) is 2/3. This means for every 1 cup of sugar, you need 2/3 cup of flour. In algebra, this becomes the equation: flour = (2/3) × sugar. That fraction 2/3? It's the **slope** of the line.",

Every proportional relationship is the equation y = kx.\n\nStudents who deeply understand proportional reasoning transition smoothly to algebra. Students who only know cross-multiplication hit a wall because they never built the conceptual foundation.\n\nThis is why your child's teacher spends so much time on ratios and proportions.

Ask, don't tell.** Instead of 'Here's how to do it,' try: 'Walk me through what you've tried so far.'\n\n**2. Show interest, not expertise.** 'I've never seen a double number line before—can you teach me how it works?' This puts your child in the teacher role, which deepens their understanding.\n\n**3. Connect math to their world.** Ratios are everywhere:\n- Sports stats: 'Steph Curry made 42 out of 100 three-pointers. What's his percentage?'\n- Shopping: 'Which is a better deal: 6 for $5 or 10 for $8?'\n- Recipes: 'We need to double this recipe. How much of each ingredient?'\n- Speed: 'We drove 120 miles in 2 hours. What was our speed?'\n\n**4. Don't dismiss the 'new' methods.** If your child says 'My teacher wants us to use a ratio table,' don't reply with 'Just cross-multiply.' Instead: 'Show me the ratio table way.'\n\n**5. Know when to step back.** If your child says 'I've got it,' trust them. Check in later: 'How did that problem set go?' Middle schoolers need autonomy.\n\n**If YOU want to learn cross-multiplication to help your child later:**\nCross-multiplication IS taught in late 7th or 8th grade. By then, your child will have the proportional reasoning foundation to understand WHY it works, not just HOW to do it.",
