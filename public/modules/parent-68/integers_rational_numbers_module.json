Today's students learn integer operations through number lines, chip models, and pattern reasoning that actually EXPLAIN these rules. This module demystifies the methods and shows you the reasoning behind the rules you memorized.",

Most adults learned integer rules by memorization. They can DO the operations but can't explain the reasoning.\n\nYour child's teacher is changing that. Instead of starting with rules, they start with **models**:\n- **Number lines** for addition and subtraction\n- **Chip models** (zero pairs) for understanding signs\n- **Pattern reasoning** for multiplication rules\n\nThe rules are still the end goal. But now your child will know what they mean, not just how to apply them.",

Start at 3\n2. Adding a negative number = move LEFT on the number line\n3. Move 5 steps left: 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 → -1 → **-2**\n\n3 + (-5) = **-2**\n\n**Why left?** Positive numbers go right (getting bigger), negative numbers go left (getting smaller).
