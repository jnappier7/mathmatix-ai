  "description": "When you learned to solve equations, you probably just 'did the same thing to both sides.' Your child might be using colored tiles and balance beams to do the same thing—but visually. Algebra tiles make the abstract concrete: variables become rectangles, constants become small squares, and solving an equation means physically removing tiles from both sides until the variable is alone. This module shows you how it works and why it's powerful.",

      "text": "Algebra tiles are physical (or virtual) manipulatives used to represent algebraic expressions and equations. Here's what they look like:\n\n**The pieces:**\n- 🟩 Small green square = **+1** (one positive unit)\n- 🟥 Small red square = **-1** (one negative unit)\n- 🟦 Blue rectangle = **+x** (one positive variable)\n- 🟧 Orange rectangle = **-x** (one negative variable)\n- (Some sets also have large squares for x², but let's start with the basics)\n\n**Key concept: Zero Pairs**\nA green square (+1) and a red square (-1) placed together make a **zero pair**: they cancel out.\n\n+1 + (-1) = 0\n\nSimilarly, a blue rectangle (+x) and an orange rectangle (-x) cancel out:\n\n+x + (-x) = 0\n\n**Why this matters:** Solving an equation is basically creating and removing zero pairs until the variable is alone. The tiles make this physical.\n\n**Example: The expression 2x + 3**\n```\n🟦🟦 🟩🟩🟩\n```\nTwo blue rectangles (2x) and three green squares (+3).\n\nYour child can touch, move, and rearrange these pieces.

      "text": "**The problem with jumping straight to abstract equation solving:**\n\nWhen you learned 'subtract 3 from both sides,' you were told it as a RULE. But WHY does it work? Because an equation is a balance—what's on the left equals what's on the right. If you remove the same amount from both sides, the balance is maintained.\n\nTiles and the balance model make this reasoning VISIBLE. Children who work with tiles:\n\n**1. Understand WHY the steps work.** They don't just memorize 'do the same to both sides'—they SEE that removing tiles from one side without the other tips the balance.\n\n**2. Handle negative numbers naturally.** Zero pairs (🟩🟥 = 0) make operations with negatives intuitive. Adding -2 means adding 2 red squares. The physical action matches the mathematical operation.\n\n**3. Make fewer errors.** Students who can visualize the balance are less likely to make sign errors or do operations to only one side.\n\n**4. Transition more smoothly to abstract algebra.** When tiles are eventually removed, the steps feel like common sense rather than arbitrary rules.\n\n**The CRA framework again:**\n- **C**oncrete: Physical tiles (6th grade)\n- **R**epresentational: Drawings of tiles (6th–7th grade)\n- **A**bstract: Symbolic algebra (7th–8th grade)\n\nMost children work with physical or virtual tiles in 6th grade, transition to drawing representations in 7th, and work fully abstractly by 8th grade.

This one question replaces a dozen rules.\n- **Check with substitution.** When your child gets an answer (like x = 4), ask them to plug it back in: 'Does 2(4) + 3 = 11? Let's check!' This builds verification habits.\n- **Don't skip the model.** If their teacher requires drawing tiles or a balance, don't say 'just solve it with algebra.' The drawing IS the algebra in visual form.\n\n**Virtual algebra tiles (free):**\nMany school districts provide virtual algebra tile tools. Ask your child's teacher for the link. These let children (and parents!) drag and drop tiles on screen.\n\n**The independence factor:**\nMiddle schoolers want to do things THEMSELVES. The best thing you can do:\n1. Ask 'Do you want help or do you want to work through it?'\n2. If they want help: 'Show me what you've tried first.'\n3. If they're stuck: 'What does the equation look like as a balance?'\n4. If they're frustrated: 'Take a break and come back to it. Sometimes math needs time to click.'\n\n**What NOT to say:**\n- 'This is easy, just do the opposite to both sides' (it's not easy when you're learning it)\n- 'Why are you using tiles? Just solve it normally' (tiles ARE normal for this stage)\n- 'I never needed tiles and I turned out fine' (different tools for different times)",
