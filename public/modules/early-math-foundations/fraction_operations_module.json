          "solution": "You want 1/2 OF 1/3, so multiply: 1/2 × 1/3.\nNumerators: 1 × 1 = 1.\nDenominators: 2 × 3 = 6.\n1/2 × 1/3 = 1/6 of the pan.\n\nArea model: Draw a rectangle for the pan. Divide it into 3 equal columns and shade 1 column (that is 1/3). Now divide those columns in half horizontally (2 rows). Shade only the top half of the already-shaded column. You shaded 1 piece out of 6 total — that is 1/6!"

When you multiply two fractions that are each less than 1, the result is always smaller than either one."

Divide: 6 ÷ 3 = 2, 3 ÷ 3 = 1. Now multiply: 2/1 × 2/1 = 4/1 = 4. Same answer, smaller numbers!"
