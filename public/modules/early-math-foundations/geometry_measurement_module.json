For length, the customary system uses inches (in), feet (ft), and yards (yd), while the metric system uses centimeters (cm) and meters (m). For weight, the customary system uses ounces (oz) and pounds (lb), and the metric system uses grams (g) and kilograms (kg). For capacity (how much liquid something holds), the customary system uses cups, pints, quarts, and gallons. The key rule for converting: when you go from a bigger unit to a smaller unit, you multiply (there are more small pieces). When you go from a smaller unit to a bigger unit, you divide (you are grouping small pieces into bigger ones).",
