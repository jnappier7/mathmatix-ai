      "content": "Division shows up in word problems in two main ways. Sharing (also called partitioning) means splitting a total equally — like dealing cards. Grouping (also called measurement division) means making groups of a certain size — like packing boxes. Some problems need more than one step: you might add or subtract first, then divide. The key is reading carefully, choosing the right operation, and always checking if your answer makes sense.",

        "Sharing problems: 'I have 96 markers and 8 tables. How many markers per table?' → 96 ÷ 8. You know the total and the number of groups.",

        "Multi-step problems: Read the whole problem first. You may need to add, subtract, or multiply before you divide.",
        "Clue words: 'equally,' 'each,' 'per,' 'shared,' 'split,' 'distributed,' and 'how many groups' often signal division.",
        "Reasonableness check: After solving, ask 'Does my answer make sense?' Multiply back to verify: quotient × divisor should equal the dividend.",

We need to find the number of groups.\n\nDivide: 156 ÷ 12 = 13.\n\nShe fills 13 boxes.\n\nCheck: 13 × 12 = 156. ✓\n\nTip: For 156 ÷ 12, you can think '12 × 10 = 120, 12 × 3 = 36, and 120 + 36 = 156. So 10 + 3 = 13.'"

If you just divided 128 ÷ 4, you'd get the wrong answer!"
