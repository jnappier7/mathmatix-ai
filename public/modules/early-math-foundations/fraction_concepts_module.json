  "description": "What fractions actually mean — before any operations. Students build understanding of fractions as parts of a whole, parts of a set, and points on a number line. They generate equivalent fractions, compare and order fractions using benchmarks and common denominators, convert between mixed numbers and improper fractions, and calculate fractions of a whole number. This conceptual foundation must be rock-solid before fraction operations.",
