In this lesson you will learn about three types of graphs: bar graphs (bars go up to show amounts), pictographs (little pictures stand for numbers), and line plots (Xs or dots above a number line). Every good graph needs three things: a title that tells what the graph is about, labels that tell what each axis or category means, and a scale or key that tells how to read the numbers.",

When you see 3 + 5 = 8, it means the left side (3 + 5) has the same value as the right side (8). When a number is missing, like square + 5 = 12, your job is to find the number that keeps both sides balanced. You can use a box (square), a question mark, or even a letter like n. Finding the missing number is the very beginning of algebra!",
