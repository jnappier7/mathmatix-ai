Compatible Numbers** — Look for pairs that add up to nice round numbers.\n- 37 + 63 = 100 (they're compatible!)\n- To add 48 + 35 + 52, notice 48 + 52 = 100, so the answer is 100 + 35 = 135.\n\n**2. Break Apart (Expanded Form)** — Split numbers into place values and add each part.\n- 346 + 230: Think 300 + 200 = 500, 40 + 30 = 70, 6 + 0 = 6. Total: 576.\n\n**3. Compensation** — Round one number to make it easier, then adjust.\n- 299 + 456: Think 300 + 456 = 756, then subtract 1 because you added 1 extra. Answer: 755.\n- 503 − 198: Think 503 − 200 = 303, then add 2 back because you subtracted 2 too many. Answer: 305.\n\n**4. Counting Up (for subtraction)** — Instead of subtracting, count up from the smaller number.\n- 1,000 − 683: Count up from 683. 683 → 700 (that's 17), 700 → 1,000 (that's 300). Total: 317.\n\nEach strategy is like a superpower — the trick is knowing when to use which one!",
