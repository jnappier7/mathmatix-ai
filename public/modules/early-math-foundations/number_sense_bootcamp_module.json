  "description": "Build the rock-solid number sense that everything else depends on. This boot camp targets five foundational skills for grades 3-5 students: understanding place value through millions and thousandths, rounding and estimation, comparing and ordering numbers, addition and subtraction fact fluency, and recognizing number patterns. Every concept is anchored in real-world contexts kids care about — money, animals, sports, snacks, and games. Diagnostic-first: assess before reteaching, skip what is solid, strengthen what is shaky.",

  "goals": [
    "Identify the place and value of any digit in numbers through the millions and decimals through the thousandths, and write numbers in standard, word, and expanded form",
    "Round whole numbers and decimals to any specified place and use estimation to check whether answers to addition, subtraction, and multiplication are reasonable",
    "Compare pairs of whole numbers or decimals using the symbols <, >, and = and order sets of numbers from least to greatest or greatest to least",
    "Recall addition and subtraction facts through 20 automatically, use make-10 and fact-family strategies, and apply mental math to solve problems quickly",
    "Identify, describe, and extend number patterns including skip counting, odd/even classification, and rule-based sequences"
  ],
  "instructionalStrategy": [
    "Diagnostic-first: open each skill with a quick probe. If the student gets it right and explains their thinking, move to practice. If they hesitate or make errors, drop into the full explanation-model-guided cycle. Never waste time reteaching what is already solid.",
    "Every problem must be grounded in a context that an 8- to 11-year-old finds relatable — money they might spend, animals they think are cool, sports they play, snacks they eat, or games they know. Abstract drill without context loses this age group fast.",
    "Place value and comparison errors often come from not lining up digits correctly. Always encourage students to stack numbers vertically and align decimal points before comparing or computing. Use the phrase 'line it up' as a consistent refrain.",
    "For addition and subtraction fact fluency, frame speed as a fun challenge rather than a stressful test. Use language like 'let us see if your brain can fire this one off' and celebrate quick recalls. Never shame slow recall — redirect to strategies like make-10 or counting on.",
    "Pattern work is the gateway to algebraic thinking. Push students to state the rule in words ('add 4 each time' or 'multiply by 3') before they extend a sequence. A student who can articulate a rule owns the concept; a student who just writes the next number may be guessing."

Because rounding lets you ESTIMATE, and estimating lets you check whether your exact answer even makes sense.\n\nHere is the rounding rule, and it works for ANY place:\n1. Find the digit in the place you are rounding to. That is your 'target digit.'\n2. Look at the digit ONE PLACE TO THE RIGHT of your target. That is the 'decider.'\n3. If the decider is 5 or more, round your target digit UP by one. If the decider is 4 or less, keep your target digit the same.\n4. Replace all digits to the RIGHT of the target with zeros (for whole numbers) or drop them (for decimals).\n\nEstimation uses rounding to get a quick, approximate answer. Before you work out a long addition or multiplication problem, round the numbers first and compute a quick estimate. Then do the exact math. If your exact answer is far away from your estimate, something probably went wrong.\n\nThink of estimation as your 'does this make sense?' alarm. If you multiply 48 x 21 and get 10,008, your estimate of 50 x 20 = 1,000 tells you the exact answer should be near 1,000, not 10,000. Alarm goes off!",
