Their decimals go on forever without repeating (√2 = 1.41421356..., π = 3.14159...).\n\n**The hierarchy:** Natural ⊂ Whole ⊂ Integer ⊂ Rational ⊂ Real. Irrational numbers fill the gaps between rationals on the number line.\n\n**Approximating on a number line:** To locate √5, note that 2² = 4 and 3² = 9, so 2 < √5 < 3.
