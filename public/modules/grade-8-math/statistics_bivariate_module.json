Negative association (as x increases, y decreases — points go down-right). No association (no clear pattern).\n3. **Strength:** Strong (points are tightly clustered around the trend) or weak (points are widely spread).\n4. **Outliers:** Any points that don't fit the overall pattern. An outlier may be a data error or a genuinely unusual observation.\n\n**Real-world example:** Plot study hours (x) vs. test score (y) for 20 students. You'd likely see a positive, linear, moderately strong association — more study time tends to mean higher scores, but not perfectly.",

The line does NOT need to pass through any actual data points (though it might).\n\n**Writing the equation:**\n1. Pick two points ON the line (not necessarily data points — points on the line itself).\n2. Calculate slope: m = (y₂ − y₁)/(x₂ − x₁).\n3. Use point-slope or plug into y = mx + b to find b.\n\n**Making predictions:**\n- Interpolation: predicting within the range of your data. More reliable.\n- Extrapolation: predicting outside the range. Less reliable — the trend may not continue.\n\n**Interpreting slope and y-intercept:**\n- Slope: 'For each additional unit of x, y changes by m units.'\n- Y-intercept: 'When x = 0, the predicted y is b.'
