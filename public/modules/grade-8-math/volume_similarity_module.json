  "description": "Build fluency with the three curved-surface volume formulas: cylinders (V = πr²h), cones (V = ⅓πr²h), and spheres (V = ⁴⁄₃πr³). Students connect each formula to its rectangular prism cousin, explore the 1/3 and 4/3 relationships, tackle composite figures, and discover the k³ scaling rule. Every problem is grounded in real-world objects — soup cans, ice cream cones, basketballs, water tanks — so students see volume as a practical measurement tool.",
