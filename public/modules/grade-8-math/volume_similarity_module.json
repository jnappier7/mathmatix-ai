  "description": "Build fluency with the three curved-surface volume formulas: cylinders (V = \u03c0r\u00b2h), cones (V = \u2153\u03c0r\u00b2h), and spheres (V = \u2074\u2044\u2083\u03c0r\u00b3). Students connect each formula to its rectangular prism cousin, explore the 1/3 and 4/3 relationships, tackle composite figures, and discover the k\u00b3 scaling rule. Every problem is grounded in real-world objects \u2014 soup cans, ice cream cones, basketballs, water tanks \u2014 so students see volume as a practical measurement tool.",
