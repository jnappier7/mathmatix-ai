They connect rigid motions to congruence and dilations to similarity, analyze angle relationships formed by parallel lines and transversals, and apply the Pythagorean theorem to find missing side lengths, diagonals, and distances between points in the coordinate plane.",

There are four main types:\n\n**Translation (slide):** Every point moves the same distance in the same direction.\nRule: (x, y) → (x + a, y + b). Example: translate by (3, −2) means right 3, down 2.\n\n**Reflection (flip):** A mirror image across a line.\nOver x-axis: (x, y) → (x, −y). Over y-axis: (x, y) → (−x, y).\n\n**Rotation (turn):** Spin around a center point (usually the origin).\n90° counterclockwise: (x, y) → (−y, x).\n180°: (x, y) → (−x, −y).\n270° counterclockwise (= 90° clockwise): (x, y) → (y, −x).\n\n**Dilation (resize):** Scale from a center point by factor k.\nFrom origin: (x, y) → (kx, ky). If k > 1, the figure gets bigger. If 0 < k < 1, it gets smaller.\n\n**Key distinction:** Translations, reflections, and rotations are rigid motions — they preserve size and shape (congruence).
