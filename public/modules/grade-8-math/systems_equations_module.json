  "description": "Master solving systems of two linear equations using graphing and substitution. Students learn to identify the intersection point as the solution, apply substitution when one variable is already isolated, and interpret special cases — parallel lines (no solution) and identical lines (infinitely many solutions). Every system is grounded in real-world 'two plans' contexts: phone plans, gym memberships, ticket sales, and more.",

    "Substitution as a precision tool: graphing shows the idea, substitution gets the exact answer. Motivate substitution by showing a graph where the intersection is at (2.5, 3.7) — hard to read off a graph.",
    "Special cases last: after students expect one intersection, surprise them with parallel lines and identical lines. Use the algebra to explain the geometry."

Read the intersection point (x, y).\n4. CHECK: Substitute (x, y) into BOTH original equations.\n\n**Why it works:** Every point on a line satisfies that line's equation. The intersection point lies on BOTH lines, so it satisfies BOTH equations.\n\n**Real-world connection:** Phone Plan A charges $20/month plus $0.10/minute. Plan B charges $30/month plus $0.05/minute.
