      "answer": "(a) Slope = 5: for each additional hour of study, the predicted test score increases by 5 points. (b) y-intercept = 60: a student who studies 0 hours is predicted to score 60 points. (c) y = 5(8) + 60 = 100.",

      "answer": "No — this would be extrapolation (predicting far outside the range of the data). The line gives y = 5(20)+60 = 160, which exceeds the maximum possible score (likely 100). The linear pattern probably doesn't continue that far.",

A strong negative correlation means x and y tend to move in opposite directions, but changing x may not cause y to change — there may be a third variable driving both.
