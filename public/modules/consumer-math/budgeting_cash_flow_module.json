      "text": "A budget is a plan for how you'll spend your money each month. The first step is understanding what kinds of expenses you have.\n\n**Fixed expenses** stay the same amount every month. Examples: rent ($1,050/month), car payment ($275/month), car insurance ($150/month). You can predict these exactly.\n\n**Variable expenses** change from month to month. Examples: groceries ($250-$350), gas ($60-$100), electricity ($80-$160 depending on season). You estimate these based on past months.\n\n**The 50/30/20 Guideline** is a simple framework for dividing your after-tax (net) income:\n- **50% — Needs**: Housing, utilities, groceries, insurance, minimum debt payments, transportation\n- **30% — Wants**: Dining out, streaming, entertainment, hobbies, gym, shopping\n- **20% — Savings & Debt**: Emergency fund, retirement, extra debt payments, sinking funds\n\nFor someone earning $2,800/month net, that means:\n- Needs: up to $1,400\n- Wants: up to $840\n- Savings: at least $560\n\nThis is a guideline, not a rigid rule. In high-cost areas, needs might take 60%. The point is to be intentional about every dollar.",

You divide the expected cost by the number of months until the expense is due and save that amount every month. When the expense arrives, the money is already waiting.\n\n**Formula:** Monthly sinking fund amount = Total expected cost / Number of months until expense\n\nExample: Holiday gifts of $600 in December. If you start saving in January, that's 12 months: $600 / 12 = $50/month. By December, you have $600 ready.\n\nSinking funds turn surprise expenses into planned line items in your budget.
