What is his effective hourly rate for the entire 48-hour week under Option B? Round to the nearest cent.",
      "answer": "$264.00 more; effective rate of $23.83/hour. Option A: 40 × $22.00 = $880.00. Option B: Regular pay = 40 × $22.00 = $880.00. OT rate = $22.00 × 1.5 = $33.00. OT pay = 8 × $33.00 = $264.00. Total = $880.00 + $264.00 = $1,144.00. Extra pay = $1,144.00 − $880.00 = $264.00. Effective hourly rate = $1,144.00 ÷ 48 = $23.83. The effective rate ($23.83) is higher than his regular rate ($22.00) because the OT hours pull the blended average up, but lower than the OT rate ($33.00) because most hours are still paid at the regular rate.",

Which option nets Jaylen more money, and by how much?",
      "answer": "W-2 nets $2,050 more per year. W-2 take-home: $55,000 × (1 − 0.23) = $55,000 × 0.77 = $42,350. 1099 take-home: $62,000 × (1 − 0.35) = $62,000 × 0.65 = $40,300. Difference: $42,350 − $40,300 = $2,050 in favor of the W-2. Even though the 1099 pays $7,000 more in gross income, the higher tax burden (35% vs 23%) wipes out that advantage and then some. As a 1099 contractor, Jaylen must pay both the employee AND employer portions of FICA (~15.3% total), plus he has no tax withholding so he must make quarterly estimated payments.",

Round to the nearest tenth of a percent. Explain why the effective rate is much lower than 22%.",
      "answer": "$5,207.50 in federal tax; 11.6% effective rate. Bracket 1: $11,000 × 0.10 = $1,100.00. Bracket 2: ($44,725 − $11,000) = $33,725 × 0.12 = $4,047.00. Bracket 3: ($45,000 − $44,725) = $275 × 0.22 = $60.50. Total tax = $1,100.00 + $4,047.00 + $60.50 = $5,207.50. Effective rate = $5,207.50 ÷ $45,000 = 0.1157 = 11.6%. The effective rate is far below 22% because the U.S. uses a progressive (marginal) tax system — each bracket rate applies ONLY to the income within that range, not to all income. Only $275 of the $45,000 is taxed at 22%. Most of the income is taxed at 10% and 12%.",

Total compensation = $52,000 + $6,000 + $2,080 = $60,080. The benefits add $8,080 in value beyond the salary — a 15.5% boost.

Job Y: Salary $50,000. Employer health insurance = $500 × 12 = $6,000/year (you pay $0). 401(k) match = $50,000 × 0.04 = $2,000/year. Effective value = $50,000 + $6,000 + $2,000 = $58,000. Difference: $58,000 − $56,200 = $1,800 in favor of Job Y. Despite an $8,000 lower salary, Job Y delivers $1,800 more in total compensation because of stronger benefits.

For Offer B, calculate annual income minus your insurance costs.\n(c) Which offer would you recommend? Justify your answer using at least two factors beyond take-home pay.",
      "answer": "(a) Monthly take-home: Offer A = $3,040; Offer B = $2,880. Offer A: Gross monthly = $48,000 ÷ 12 = $4,000. Taxes = $4,000 × 0.24 = $960. Take-home = $4,000 − $960 = $3,040. (Insurance is free, so no additional cost.) Offer B: Gross monthly = $60,000 ÷ 12 = $5,000. Taxes = $5,000 × 0.34 = $1,700. After-tax = $5,000 − $1,700 = $3,300. Insurance = $420. Take-home = $3,300 − $420 = $2,880. Offer A take-home is $160/month higher ($1,920/year more).\n\n(b) Total annual compensation: Offer A = $55,920; Offer B = $54,960. Offer A: Salary $48,000 + health insurance ($500 × 12 = $6,000) + 401(k) match ($48,000 × 0.04 = $1,920) = $55,920. Offer B: Income $60,000 − own insurance ($420 × 12 = $5,040) = $54,960. Offer A total compensation is $960 higher.\n\n(c) Recommended: Offer A. Justification: (1) Offer A provides $160 more per month in take-home pay despite a $12,000 lower gross income, because the W-2 tax rate is 10 percentage points lower. (2) The 4% 401(k) match adds $1,920/year in free retirement savings that Offer B does not provide. (3) 10 days of PTO means your friend gets paid while taking time off — a freelancer earning $0 on vacation days loses roughly $230 per day not worked. (4) As a W-2 employee, taxes are withheld automatically; a 1099 contractor must save for and file quarterly estimated tax payments or face penalties. Offer B may make sense for someone who values schedule flexibility and can deduct business expenses, but purely on compensation, Offer A wins.",
