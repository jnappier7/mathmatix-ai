If he saves only $400 per month instead, how many months does it take?",

Scenario 2 (save $400/month): $7,400 / $400 = 18.5 months, so 19 months to fully fund it. Redirecting all non-essential spending saves 6 months of time compared to the $400/month plan.",

      "answer": "Monthly savings: $120 - $40 = $80. Total contributions over 2 years: $80 x 24 = $1,920. For simple interest on regular contributions, each month's deposit earns interest for a different length of time. However, using the average balance method: the average amount in the account over 2 years is approximately $1,920 / 2 = $960. Interest on average balance: $960 x 0.05 x 2 = $96. Total after 2 years: $1,920 + $96 = $2,016. The opportunity cost of continuing to eat out at $120/month is approximately $2,016 Carlos could have saved and earned.",

What is the opportunity cost of choosing option A? What would the money be worth if she chose option B? Round to the nearest cent.",
      "answer": "Option B value: A = $3,000(1 + 0.06)^5 = $3,000(1.06)^5. (1.06)^5 = 1.338226. A = $3,000 x 1.338226 = $4,014.68. If Nadia buys the TV and console, her opportunity cost is $4,014.68 - $3,000 = $1,014.68 in lost investment growth. The electronics cost her not just $3,000 today, but $4,014.68 in future value.
