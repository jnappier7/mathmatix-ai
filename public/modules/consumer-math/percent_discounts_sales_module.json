Unit price — the cost per single unit of measurement (per ounce, per count, per pound) — is the only honest way to compare products of different sizes. Most grocery stores list it on the shelf tag in small print, but you should know how to calculate it yourself. And here's the real-world twist: the lowest unit price only wins if you'll actually USE everything you buy.",
