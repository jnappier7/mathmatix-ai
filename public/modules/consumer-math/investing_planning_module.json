      "skill": "cm-why-investing",
      "content": "Here is the uncomfortable truth about cash: it loses value every year. Inflation means the prices of goods and services rise over time, so a dollar today buys less than a dollar ten years ago. A gallon of milk that cost $3.00 in 2014 costs closer to $4.25 in 2024. A savings account earning 1-2% interest per year cannot keep up with inflation averaging 2-4% per year. That means money sitting in a savings account is actually shrinking in purchasing power. Investing exists to solve this problem. Historically, diversified stock investments have returned roughly 7-10% per year over long periods, which outpaces inflation and allows your money to genuinely grow. The tradeoff is risk: investments can lose value in the short term, but over decades the trend has been upward. Understanding this tradeoff is the foundation of every financial decision you will make.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Inflation averages roughly 2-4% per year in the U.S., meaning prices double approximately every 18-36 years",

        "The stock market has historically returned approximately 7-10% per year on average over long periods (decades), outpacing inflation",
        "Investing is not gambling — it is the strategy for making your money grow faster than prices rise",
        "Risk and reward are linked: higher potential returns come with higher short-term volatility, but time reduces risk significantly"

If the company does well, your share becomes worth more. A bond is a loan you make to a company or government — they pay you back with interest over a set period. Bonds are generally lower risk but lower return. An index fund is a bundle of many stocks packaged together — instead of picking one company, you own a slice of hundreds of companies at once (like buying the whole pizza instead of one slice). The key concept tying these together is diversification: spreading your money across many investments so that if one fails, your whole portfolio does not collapse.",

      "content": "Compound growth is the single most important concept in long-term investing. When your investment earns a return, that return gets added to your balance — and then the next year, you earn a return on the bigger balance. It is growth on top of growth, and over decades it produces staggering results. The Rule of 72 is a quick estimation tool: divide 72 by the annual interest rate to find how many years it takes for your money to double. At 8%, your money doubles every 9 years. The critical lesson of this section is that TIME matters more than the AMOUNT you invest. A person who invests $200 per month starting at age 22 will end up with far more money at retirement than someone who invests $400 per month starting at age 32 — even though the second person invests twice as much each month. Starting early gives compound growth more time to work, and that extra time is worth more than extra money.",
