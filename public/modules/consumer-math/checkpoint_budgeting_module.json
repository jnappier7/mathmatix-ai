      "answer": "Fixed: Rent ($850), Car payment ($275). Variable: Groceries ($350), Dining out ($150), Utilities ($180). Commonly misclassified: Utilities appear fixed because they arrive every month, but the amount changes based on usage (heating in winter, cooling in summer), making them variable.

Jordan's needs consume too large a share of income. The biggest lever is rent ($850 = 30.4% of income alone). Jordan could look for a less expensive apartment or take on a roommate.

Clothing: $75 to $25 (save $50). Savings transfer: $200 to $100 (save $100). Total cuts = $100 + $50 + $100 = $250. New Variable total = $940 - $150 = $790. New Savings = $100. New Total Expenses = $1,310 + $790 + $100 = $2,200. Surplus = $0. (Any combination cutting $250 from variable/savings is acceptable.) (c) Fixed expenses like rent and car payment are locked in by contracts or leases. Jordan cannot reduce rent mid-lease or skip a car payment without penalty.

      "answer": "(a) Car registration: $180 / 12 = $15.00/month. Holiday gifts: $360 / 12 = $30.00/month. Dental visits: $220 / 12 = $18.33/month. Renter's insurance: $240 / 12 = $20.00/month. (b) Total = $15.00 + $30.00 + $18.33 + $20.00 = $83.33/month. (c) Jordan's $350 monthly surplus can absorb the $83.33 sinking fund total, leaving $266.67 remaining surplus.

How many months remain from June through December? What adjusted monthly contribution is needed to reach $360 by December?\n(c) In 2-3 sentences, explain the difference between an irregular expense and an emergency expense. Give one example of each from everyday life.",
      "answer": "(a) Contributions made in January and February only = 2 x $30 = $60 saved through end of May. (b) Months remaining: June, July, August, September, October, November, December = 7 months. Amount still needed: $360 - $60 = $300. Adjusted contribution: $300 / 7 = $42.86/month. (c) Irregular expenses are predictable costs that occur on a non-monthly schedule — you know they are coming and can calculate the exact amount (e.g., annual car registration, holiday gifts). Emergency expenses are unexpected events you cannot predict in timing or amount (e.g., a car breakdown, an emergency room visit).

Identify at least two specific expenses from Jordan's budget that could be reduced. For each, state the current amount, the reduced amount, and the dollar savings.\n(c) Show that the surplus plus your proposed cuts meet the monthly savings target. Write 2-3 sentences justifying why your chosen cuts are realistic and sustainable for 6 months.",
      "answer": "(a) $3,000 / 6 = $500 per month needed. (b) Jordan needs $500 - $350 = $150 more per month. Example cuts: Dining out from $150 to $75 (save $75). Clothing from $75 to $0 (save $75). Total additional savings: $75 + $75 = $150. (c) $350 surplus + $150 in cuts = $500/month, meeting the target. These cuts are sustainable because dining out is discretionary — Jordan can meal-prep and eat at home more often while still allowing $75 for occasional restaurant meals. Clothing purchases can be paused entirely for 6 months since this is a short-term sacrifice with a clear end date. Any combination of variable-expense cuts totaling at least $150 is acceptable with valid justification.",

Assume 22 workdays per month and a round trip each day.\n(c) Write 3-4 sentences recommending which option is better for Jordan. Your justification MUST reference at least two specific dollar amounts and the time trade-off.",
      "answer": "(a) Monthly savings = $495 - $145 = $350/month. (b) Additional time per one-way trip = 55 - 20 = 35 minutes. Round-trip additional time per day = 70 minutes. Monthly additional time = 70 x 22 = 1,540 minutes = 25.7 hours/month. (c) Option B saves $350/month ($4,200/year), which would let Jordan fully fund the emergency fund and all sinking funds. However, it costs an extra 25.7 hours per month in commute time. If Jordan values that time at more than $13.62/hour ($350 / 25.7 hours), keeping the car may be worthwhile. For someone earning around $17-20/hour, losing 25.7 hours is a significant real cost. The best choice depends on whether Jordan can use transit time productively (reading, studying) or whether the lost time reduces quality of life.

New surplus: $530. Improvement: $180/month ($2,160/year). (c) Jordan should strongly consider taking the new job. Although rent jumps $250 (the biggest increase), groceries rise $70, and smaller increases hit insurance (+$25), utilities (+$30), gas (+$30), and gym (+$15) for a total cost-of-living increase of $420/month, the $600 net income increase more than offsets it, producing a $530 surplus versus the current $350 — a $180/month improvement. That extra $180 could accelerate the emergency fund or fully cover the $83.33/month in sinking funds with money to spare. One caution: higher-cost cities often carry hidden expenses (parking, tolls, higher service fees) that could erode the $180 gain, so Jordan should budget a small cushion before committing.
