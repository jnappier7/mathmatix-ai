      "answer": "The monthly interest rate is the APR divided by 12: 19.99% ÷ 12 = 1.666%. As a decimal: 0.1999 ÷ 12 = 0.016658. Monthly interest charge = $3,800 × 0.016658 = $63.30.

      "answer": "(a) Minimum payment = $2,400 × 0.02 = $48.00. (b) Monthly interest rate = 21.99% ÷ 12 = 1.8325%. Interest charge = $2,400 × 0.018325 = $43.98.

      "question": "Marcus owes $5,000 on a credit card with 22.99% APR. He is considering two payoff strategies:\n\n• Strategy A: Pay $100/month → estimated payoff: 167 months (nearly 14 years), total paid: $16,601\n• Strategy B: Pay $250/month → estimated payoff: 25 months (about 2 years), total paid: $6,194\n\n(a) How much total interest does each strategy cost?\n(b) How much interest does Marcus save by choosing Strategy B?\n(c) In your own words, explain why the difference is so dramatic.",
      "answer": "(a) Strategy A total interest = $16,601 − $5,000 = $11,601. Strategy B total interest = $6,194 − $5,000 = $1,194. (b) Interest saved = $11,601 − $1,194 = $10,407. By paying $150 more per month, Marcus saves $10,407 in interest and pays off the debt 142 months (nearly 12 years) sooner. (c) At $100/month, almost the entire payment goes to interest each month (the first month's interest alone is $95.79 of the $100 payment). The balance barely shrinks, so interest keeps piling up month after month for over a decade. At $250/month, a much larger chunk attacks the principal each month, so the balance drops quickly and generates less interest. This is the minimum payment trap — the credit card company profits enormously from customers who pay only the minimum.",

Priya should choose Loan C. It saves $1,886.88 in interest ($3,872.80 − $1,985.92), is paid off a full year sooner, and actually has a slightly lower monthly payment ($395.54 vs $397.88).

      "question": "Below is a snippet from an amortization table for a $20,000 auto loan at 6.0% APR for 60 months (monthly payment: $386.66):\n\n| Payment # | Payment  | Interest | Principal | Remaining Balance |\n|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| 1         | $386.66  | $100.00  | $286.66   | $19,713.34        |\n| 2         | $386.66  | $98.57   | $288.09   | $19,425.25        |\n| 3         | $386.66  | $97.13   | $289.53   | $19,135.72        |\n\n(a) What percentage of Payment #1 goes to interest?\n(b) Why does the interest portion decrease with each payment?",
      "answer": "(a) $100.00 ÷ $386.66 = 0.2586 = 25.9%. More than a quarter of the first payment is pure interest. (b) Each month, the remaining balance decreases (from $20,000 to $19,713.34 to $19,425.25, etc.). Since monthly interest is calculated as (APR ÷ 12) × remaining balance, a lower balance means less interest. As the interest portion shrinks, more of the fixed $386.66 payment goes toward principal, which further reduces the balance — creating a virtuous cycle that accelerates payoff over time.",

      "answer": "(a) $380.94 ÷ $386.66 = 0.9852 = 98.5%. Almost the entire payment now goes to principal, compared to only 74.1% in Payment #1. (b) Early in the loan, the balance is high ($20,000), so each month generates substantial interest ($100). An extra payment early reduces that high balance, which means every single future month charges less interest — and that savings compounds over the remaining 50+ payments. Late in the loan, the balance is already low ($762.89), interest is minimal ($5.72), and there are only a few payments left. There simply is not enough remaining interest to save. A $500 extra payment after Payment #1 saves interest across 58 future months; the same $500 after Payment #57 only affects 2-3 remaining months.",

      "answer": "(a) New interest on Payment #2 = $19,213.34 × 0.005 = $96.07. (b) Original interest was $98.57. Savings on one month = $98.57 − $96.07 = $2.50. This $2.50 monthly savings does not happen just once — the lower balance means every subsequent payment charges less interest too. The total interest savings from this single $500 extra payment compounds across the remaining 58 payments, saving approximately $80–$90 over the life of the loan. This is why financial advisors say the best time to make extra payments is as early as possible.",

      "answer": "(a) $75 ÷ $500 = 0.15 = 15% for just two weeks. (b) APR = 15% × 26 = 390%. A $75 fee sounds small, but when you realize it is 15% for only 14 days, the annualized rate is 390%. For comparison, even a high-interest credit card charges about 25% APR. The payday loan costs more than 15 times as much.

(2) Weekly payment structure — quoting $89.99/week instead of total cost ($1,799.80) or APR deliberately obscures how expensive the loan is. (3) 'Everyone is approved' — no responsible lender approves every applicant regardless of ability to repay; this signals predatory intent. (4) 'No paperwork required' — legitimate lenders require income verification and a written agreement with clear terms; no paperwork means no consumer protections. (5) APR is never disclosed — federal Truth in Lending laws require APR disclosure; hiding it is a major red flag.

And if Deshawn cannot pay the full $920 in 2 weeks, he will likely roll over the loan, paying another $120 fee each cycle. The average payday borrower rolls over 8 times, which would mean $120 × 8 = $960 in fees alone — more than the original loan. Option B: Total = $275.52 × 3 = $826.56. Interest = $26.56. Option C: Total = $70.07 × 12 = $840.84. Interest = $40.84. Best choice: Option B if Deshawn can afford $275.52/month — lowest total cost at only $26.56 in interest. Option C if he needs lower monthly payments — only $14.28 more in total interest but spreads the payments to $70.07/month, which may be more manageable. Avoid at all costs: Option A.
