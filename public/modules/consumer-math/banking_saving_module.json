      "content": "Simple interest is the most straightforward way to calculate the cost of borrowing money or the reward for saving it. When you deposit money in a savings account or take out a loan, interest is calculated only on the original amount — called the principal. The formula is I = Prt, where I is the interest earned (or owed), P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate as a decimal, and t is the time in years. The total amount after interest is A = P + I. Two critical conversions: always divide a percent rate by 100 to get the decimal (3% becomes 0.03), and always convert months to years by dividing by 12 (18 months = 1.5 years).",

Common compounding frequencies: annually (n = 1), semi-annually (n = 2), quarterly (n = 4), monthly (n = 12), daily (n = 365).

When you spend $5 on a coffee, the opportunity cost is what that $5 could have done instead — gone into savings, earned interest, or been put toward a goal. Opportunity cost is not always about money; it can involve time, experiences, or other resources. In personal finance, quantifying opportunity cost helps you make smarter spending decisions. A daily $5 coffee habit on weekdays costs $1,300 per year. If that money were invested instead at 5% annual return, it would grow to $1,365 in just one year. Over 10 years, the total opportunity cost can be thousands of dollars.",
