        "Amounts owed / credit utilization (30%): how much of your available credit you are using. Using $2,000 of a $10,000 limit = 20% utilization. Under 30% is good; under 10% is excellent.",

      "content": "Amortization is the process of paying off a loan through regular payments over time. The critical insight is that each payment is split between interest and principal \u2014 and that split changes dramatically over the life of the loan. Early payments are mostly interest. Late payments are mostly principal. This is why it feels like you are barely making progress in the first few years of a mortgage.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Every loan payment has two parts: the interest portion (what you pay the bank for borrowing) and the principal portion (what actually reduces your balance).",
        "In early payments, interest is high because the balance is large. Example: on a $180,000 mortgage at 6%, payment #1 is $1,079 \u2014 but $900 goes to interest and only $179 goes to principal.",
        "In later payments, interest is lower because the balance has shrunk. The same $1,079 payment sends more and more toward principal as months go by.",
        "An amortization table shows the breakdown for every payment: payment number, interest portion, principal portion, and remaining balance.",
        "Extra payments go entirely toward principal (since your scheduled interest is already covered). Even $50-$100 extra per month can save tens of thousands in interest and years off a mortgage.",
        "This is why refinancing to a lower rate or making extra payments early in the loan saves the most money \u2014 you reduce the balance while interest has the biggest impact."
