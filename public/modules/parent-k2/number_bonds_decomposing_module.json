  "description": "Number bonds are the building blocks of modern early math. Instead of memorizing that 7 + 3 = 10, your child learns that 10 can be broken into 7 and 3 (or 6 and 4, or 5 and 5). This flexibility with numbers is called 'number sense,' and research shows it's the strongest predictor of later math success. This module explains what number bonds are, how they work, and why they matter.",

      "text": "If you've looked at your child's math homework and seen circles connected by lines with numbers in them, you've seen **number bonds**. They look something like this:\n\n```\n      (10)\n      / \\\n    (7)  (3)\n```\n\nThe big circle (or box) at the top is the **whole**. The two circles at the bottom are the **parts**. Together, the parts make the whole: 7 + 3 = 10.\n\nThis might seem like a complicated way to show something simple. But here's the key insight: your child isn't just learning that 7 + 3 = 10. They're learning that **10 can be broken into 7 and 3**. And also into 6 and 4. And 5 and 5. And 8 and 2.\n\nThis is called **decomposing**—breaking a number into parts. It's the foundation of everything your child will do in math from addition all the way through algebra.",
      "initialPrompt": "Think about how you learned addition facts as a child. Was it mostly through flash cards and repetition? That approach works—but number bonds add something flash cards can't: understanding of WHY 7 + 3 = 10. Can you think of all the ways to make 10 using two numbers?"

          "tip": "Notice how this one diagram practices BOTH addition (5 + 3 = 8) and subtraction (8 - 5 = 3). That's the power of number bonds—they show the relationship between the operations."

The number bond gives you the WHOLE FAMILY of facts and the understanding of how numbers relate.",
          "tip": "Both approaches are valid! Flash cards build speed. Number bonds build understanding. The best approach uses both—and today's classrooms lean toward understanding first, then speed."

      "title": "Why Decomposing Numbers Matters",
      "text": "You might be thinking: 'This seems like a lot of work for simple addition.' Here's why it matters:\n\n**1. It builds flexibility.** When your child faces 8 + 7 later, they can think: 'I know 8 + 2 = 10, so 8 + 7 = 8 + 2 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15.' That's the **making ten** strategy—and it comes directly from number bond practice.\n\n**2. It prepares for subtraction.** If your child knows that 10 breaks into 7 and 3, then 10 - 7 = 3 is automatic. They don't need a separate set of subtraction facts.\n\n**3. It prevents math anxiety.** Children who understand WHY math works are less likely to panic when they forget a fact. They have strategies to figure it out.\n\n**4. It scales to bigger numbers.** Decomposing 47 into 40 + 7 (place value!) uses the same thinking. So does decomposing 3/4 into 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 (fractions!). The skill grows with your child.\n\nResearch from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) consistently shows that students who develop number sense through decomposing outperform peers who rely on memorization alone—especially when math gets more complex in later grades.",
      "initialPrompt": "Can you see how knowing all the bonds for 10 would help a child solve 8 + 5 without memorizing it? (Hint: decompose the 5 into 2 + 3, then use the 8 + 2 = 10 bond.)"

Ask: 'How many ways can we break this number into two parts?' Make it a game—who can find more?\n\n**2. Use everyday objects.** 'We have 8 strawberries. If you eat 3, how many are left?' You just practiced a number bond!\n\n**3. Play with dominoes.** Each domino is a number bond! The two sides are the parts, and the total dots are the whole.\n\n**4. Don't say 'that's wrong—here's how I learned it.'** Instead try: 'Show me how your teacher does it' or 'Can you teach me that way?' This validates their learning and builds their confidence.\n\n**5. Celebrate flexibility.** When your child finds multiple ways to decompose a number, praise the thinking: 'Wow, you found FOUR ways to make 7—that's awesome number sense!'\n\n**What NOT to do:**\n- Don't insist they solve it your way (even if yours is faster)\n- Don't skip the diagram and just give the answer\n- Don't rush them to 'just know it'—understanding takes time, and it's time well spent",
