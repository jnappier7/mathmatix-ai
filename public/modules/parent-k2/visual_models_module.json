These visual tools, borrowed from the world's highest-performing math education systems, give children a concrete way to understand operations before they memorize procedures. This module teaches you to read and use each model so you can confidently support your child.",

      "text": "**The research is clear:** Countries that use visual models (Singapore, Japan, Netherlands) consistently outperform the US in international math assessments—by significant margins.\n\n**Here's why:**\n\n**1. They make the invisible visible.** Word problems require children to figure out the STRUCTURE of the problem (is it combining? comparing? grouping?) before they can choose an operation. Bar models make the structure visible.\n\n**2. They prevent the 'keyword' trap.** Many children learn to look for keywords ('more' means add, 'left' means subtract). This breaks down quickly with problems like 'Sam has 5 MORE than Ava.' (It's actually subtraction to find Ava's amount!) Bar models focus on relationships, not keywords.\n\n**3. They scale.** The same bar model your child draws in 1st grade for '8 + ? = 15' becomes the model they use in 5th grade for fraction word problems and in middle school for algebraic equations. ONE tool, many years of use.\n\n**4. They build confidence.** Children who draw a model before computing make fewer errors and feel less anxious about word problems. The model gives them a plan.",

Instead, ask these three questions:\n\n1. **'What do you know?'** (Identify the given information)\n2. **'What are you trying to find?'** (Identify the question)\n3. **'Can you draw something to show what's happening?'** (Encourage a model)\n\nThis question sequence works for EVERY word problem from 1st grade through high school.\n\n**Common parent mistakes to avoid:**\n- Drawing the model FOR your child (let them struggle—productive struggle builds understanding)\n- Saying 'you don't need to draw that' (their teacher requires it for good reason)\n- Teaching your child to look for keywords instead of drawing models (keywords fail; models don't)\n\n**If your child's model is 'wrong' but leads to the right answer:**\nThat's usually fine! There's more than one way to model a problem. Ask them to explain their drawing. If they can justify it, celebrate the thinking.\n\n**If your child's model is wrong and leads to a wrong answer:**\nGo back to question 1: 'What do you know?' Often the error is in reading the problem, not in the math. The model will reveal where the misunderstanding is.\n\n**You've completed the K–2 Parent Guide!** You now understand number bonds, ten frames, counting strategies, and visual models. These four tools are the foundation of everything your child will learn in elementary math. With this knowledge, you can confidently read their homework, support their strategies, and celebrate their mathematical thinking.",
