  "description": "Your child has moved past counting from 1 every time—and that's a good thing. 'Counting on' (starting from the larger number) and 'counting back' are strategies that build efficiency and mental math skills. This module explains these strategies, the natural progression from concrete counting to fluent math facts, and how to support your child through each stage without rushing.",

      "text": "When your child solves 8 + 3, they might say: 'Eight... nine, ten, eleven!' and hold up 3 fingers as they count. This is called **counting on**—starting from the larger number and counting forward.\n\nYou might think: 'Why don't they just know that 8 + 3 = 11?' Here's the thing—counting on IS the stage that leads to 'just knowing.' It's not a failure to memorize; it's the natural next step after 'counting all' (starting from 1 and counting every single object).\n\n**The progression:**\n1. **Counting all (K):** To solve 3 + 5, count out 3 objects, then 5 objects, then count ALL of them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n2. **Counting on (K–1):** To solve 3 + 5, start at 5 (the bigger number) and count: 6, 7, 8. Much more efficient!\n3. **Derived facts (1–2):** 'I know 5 + 5 = 10, so 5 + 3 must be 2 less: 8.' Using facts you know to figure out facts you don't.\n4. **Known facts (2+):** 'I just know 5 + 3 = 8.' Automatic recall.\n\nYour child needs to spend time at each stage. Rushing to stage 4 without the foundation of stages 1–3 leads to fragile, easily-forgotten facts.",
      "initialPrompt": "Where do you think your child is on this progression? Most K–1 students are at stage 2 (counting on), and that's exactly where they should be."

          "solution": "**Strategy:** Start from the LARGER number (7) and count on 4:\n'Seven... eight, nine, ten, eleven!'\n\nAnswer: **11**\n\nNotice the child starts from 7, not 4—they've learned the **commutative property** (4 + 7 = 7 + 4) even if they don't know the name yet. Starting from the bigger number means fewer counts.",
          "tip": "If your child starts from the smaller number (4... 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), they'll get the right answer but work harder. Gently suggest: 'What if you started from the bigger number?'"

          "solution": "**Counting back:** Start at 13 and count backward 4:\n'Thirteen... twelve, eleven, ten, nine!'\n\nAnswer: **9**\n\nCounting back works well when subtracting small numbers (1, 2, or 3). For bigger subtractions, the next strategy is better.",
          "tip": "Counting back gets tricky with bigger numbers. If your child struggles with 15 - 7 by counting back, that's normal—it's time for the 'think-addition' strategy."

Since children typically learn addition facts first, this leverages what they already know.",
          "tip": "Think-addition is one of the most powerful strategies in early math—and most parents never learned it. It reframes subtraction as 'finding the missing part,' which connects directly to number bonds."

      "title": "The Fingers Debate—And What Research Says",
      "text": "Let's address the elephant in the room: **Should my child still be using fingers?**\n\n**Short answer:** Probably yes, and that's fine.\n\n**Longer answer:** Research from Stanford's math education labs shows that finger representation is connected to math ability well into adulthood. Brain imaging studies show that even when adults solve math problems mentally, the brain region associated with fingers lights up.\n\nHere's the developmental reality:\n- **K–1st grade:** Fingers are a completely normal, healthy tool. Most children use them.\n- **2nd grade:** Children should be REDUCING finger use as derived facts and known facts take over.\n- **3rd grade and beyond:** Most basic facts should be automatic, with fingers used occasionally for harder computations.\n\n**What helps the transition:**\n- Lots of number bond practice (Unit 1)\n- Ten frame work (Unit 2)\n- Games that build speed naturally (card games, dice games)\n- TIME—fluency develops over months, not days\n\n**What DOESN'T help:**\n- Telling your child 'put your fingers down'\n- Timed tests before facts are solid (creates anxiety)\n- Flash cards as the ONLY practice tool\n\nThe goal is for counting on to gradually be replaced by 'just knowing'—but the knowing has to be built on understanding, not pressure.",
      "initialPrompt": "Does this change how you think about your child's finger use? The key takeaway: fingers are a bridge, not a crutch, and your child will cross that bridge in their own time."

The physical dots support counting-on.\n\n**3. 'How many more?' in daily life.** 'You have 6 crackers and your brother has 9. How many more does he have?'
