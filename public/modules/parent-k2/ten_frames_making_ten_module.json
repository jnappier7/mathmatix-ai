This simple 2×5 grid helps children 'see' numbers, build relationships to 5 and 10, and develop the 'making ten' strategy that replaces carrying with genuine place value understanding. If your child's homework features grids with dots, this module explains everything you need to know.",

      "text": "A **ten frame** is a simple 2-row, 5-column grid—10 spaces total:\n\n```\n┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐\n│   │   │   │   │   │\n├───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤\n│   │   │   │   │   │\n└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘\n```\n\nChildren place dots, counters, or stickers in the spaces to represent numbers. Here's what the number 7 looks like:\n\n```\n┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐\n│ ● │ ● │ ● │ ● │ ● │\n├───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤\n│ ● │ ● │   │   │   │\n└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘\n```\n\nThe top row is full (5), plus 2 more on the bottom = 7. Notice something powerful: you can INSTANTLY see that 7 is '5 and 2 more' and also that it's '3 away from 10' (three empty spaces).\n\nThis is called **subitizing**—recognizing a quantity without counting one by one. You already do this with dice (you see ⚄ and know it's 5 without counting dots). Ten frames extend that ability to numbers up to 10 and beyond.",
      "initialPrompt": "Look at the ten frame showing 7 above. Without counting, can you tell how many spaces are empty? That instant recognition is exactly what your child is building."

          "tip": "The child thinks: '8 needs 2 more to make 10. I can take 2 from the 5, leaving 3. So it's 10 + 3 = 13.' This uses the number bonds from Unit 1!"

Write 3, carry the 1.'\n\n**Making ten method:**\n8 + 5\n= 8 + 2 + 3\n= 10 + 3\n= 13\n\n**What's different?** Both get 13. But the traditional method requires memorizing 8 + 5 = 13 as a fact. The making ten method BUILDS that fact from understanding. Your child knows WHY 8 + 5 = 13—because 8 + 2 = 10, and there are 3 left over.\n\nEven better: this same strategy works for 28 + 5, 48 + 5, and 108 + 5. The 'carrying' method requires relearning for bigger numbers. Making ten just scales up.",

      "title": "Why Making Ten Is Worth the Extra Steps",
      "text": "Here's what making ten actually builds:\n\n**1. Place value understanding.** When your child regroups around 10, they're learning that 13 means '1 ten and 3 ones.' This is the SAME concept behind carrying—but your child understands the WHY, not just the procedure.\n\n**2. Mental math for life.** Adults who are good at mental math? They make ten intuitively. When you mentally calculate 48 + 7, you probably think '48 + 2 = 50, plus 5 = 55.' That IS making ten (or making fifty). You're just so practiced you don't notice the steps anymore.\n\n**3. Multi-digit addition.** In 2nd and 3rd grade, your child will add numbers like 47 + 36. The traditional algorithm says 'add the ones, carry the 1.' Making ten gives them the understanding of WHY you carry—because 7 + 6 = 13, which is 1 ten and 3 ones, and that extra ten goes in the tens column.\n\n**4. Research-backed.** Studies from Singapore, Japan, and the Netherlands—countries that consistently outperform the US in math—all use making ten as a foundational strategy in early grades.",
