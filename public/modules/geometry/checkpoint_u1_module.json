      "answer": "(a) Yes — P, Q, R all lie on line k, so they are collinear. (b) No — S does not lie on line k. (c) Yes — any three points determine a plane, and we can always find a plane containing P, Q, R, and S (since the first three are collinear, adding any fourth point still keeps them coplanar).",
