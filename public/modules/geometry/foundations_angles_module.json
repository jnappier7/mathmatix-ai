      "text": "Welcome to Geometry! Everything in geometry starts with three undefined terms: **points**, **lines**, and **planes**. A point is a location with no size—just a dot we label with a capital letter (A). A line extends infinitely in both directions through two points. A plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions. These three ideas are the building blocks for everything we'll study this year.",

Lines can intersect (cross at one point), be parallel (never cross, same plane), or be skew (never cross, different planes). Understanding these relationships is fundamental to geometric reasoning.",

The order of the letters matters—the first letter is the endpoint. If we reversed it, ray BA would start at B and go through A in the opposite direction.",
