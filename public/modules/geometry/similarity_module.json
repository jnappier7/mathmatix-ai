    "AA Similarity is the most commonly used—if two angles match, the triangles MUST be similar (the third angle is forced by the angle sum theorem).",
    "Use proportions systematically: corresponding sides are in the same ratio. Write ratios consistently (small/large or large/small, but stay consistent).",
    "Geometric mean connects to altitude-on-hypotenuse: the altitude creates two triangles similar to each other AND to the original."
