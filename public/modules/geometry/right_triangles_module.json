You can use it to find any missing side when you know the other two. If solving for a leg: a = √(c² - b²). If solving for the hypotenuse: c = √(a² + b²).\n\nCommon Pythagorean triples to recognize: **3-4-5**, **5-12-13**, **8-15-17**, **7-24-25**. Multiples also work (e.g., 6-8-10 is 2× the 3-4-5).",
