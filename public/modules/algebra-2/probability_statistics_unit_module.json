    "The permutation vs. combination distinction boils down to one question: DOES ORDER MATTER? Arranging books on a shelf = permutation (ABC \u2260 BCA). Choosing a committee = combination (picking Alice, Bob, Carol is the same committee regardless of order). Drill this distinction relentlessly.",
