    "The permutation vs. combination distinction boils down to one question: DOES ORDER MATTER? Arranging books on a shelf = permutation (ABC ≠ BCA). Choosing a committee = combination (picking Alice, Bob, Carol is the same committee regardless of order). Drill this distinction relentlessly.",
    "Probability is a fraction: P(event) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes. It always lives between 0 and 1. P(not A) = 1 - P(A) is the single most useful probability tool — often it's easier to count what you DON'T want.",
    "Conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B) answers: 'Given that B happened, what's the probability of A?' Independence means P(A|B) = P(A) — knowing B doesn't change A's probability. This is the conceptual core.",
    "Binomial probability applies when: (1) fixed number of trials n, (2) each trial has exactly two outcomes (success/failure), (3) probability p is constant, (4) trials are independent. The formula P(X = k) = C(n,k) · p^k · (1-p)^(n-k) combines counting (C(n,k)) with probability (p^k · q^(n-k)).",
    "The normal distribution and Empirical Rule give students a framework for understanding data spread. 68% within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, 99.7% within 3σ. This connects probability to real-world data interpretation and sets up statistics courses."
