    "The #1 mistake in all of radical mathematics: √(a+b) ≠ √a + √b. Radicals distribute over MULTIPLICATION and DIVISION, never addition or subtraction. Drill this until it's reflexive.",
    "When solving radical equations: ISOLATE the radical first, THEN raise both sides to the appropriate power. If there are two radicals, isolate one, square, then isolate the remaining radical and square again.",
    "ALWAYS check for extraneous solutions. Squaring both sides can introduce false solutions because it destroys sign information: (-3)² = 3² but -3 ≠ 3.",
    "Applications ground the abstract: Pythagorean theorem uses √, pendulum period T = 2π√(L/g), distance formula, and Heron's formula all require radical fluency."
