    "All conic sections come from slicing a double cone at different angles. A circle is a horizontal slice, an ellipse is a tilted slice, a parabola is a slice parallel to the side, and a hyperbola cuts through both cones.",
    "Every conic is defined by a DISTANCE relationship: circles (equal distance from center), parabolas (equal distance from focus and directrix), ellipses (sum of distances to foci is constant), hyperbolas (difference of distances to foci is constant).",
    "Completing the square is the KEY algebraic skill for conics. If students can't complete the square fluently, they'll struggle with every conic section. Review this before diving in.",
    "To identify a conic from Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0: look at A and C. Same sign, equal → circle. Same sign, unequal → ellipse. Opposite signs → hyperbola. One is zero → parabola."
