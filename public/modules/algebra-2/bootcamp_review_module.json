    "This is NOT a reteach of Algebra 1—it's a fast-paced diagnostic boot camp. The AI should assess FIRST, then target gaps. Students who demonstrate fluency should move quickly; students with gaps get focused mini-reteach.",
    "Factoring is the #1 Algebra 1 skill that decays over summer. Hit it hard and keep it alive all year with daily warm-ups.",
    "Function notation confusion (f(3) vs 3f, f(x+2) vs f(x)+2) must be cleared up NOW before composition and inverses build on it.",
    "Exponent rules are the foundation for radicals (Unit 6) and logarithms (Unit 5). Any gaps here will cascade. Diagnose and fix immediately.",
    "This unit establishes the 'non-negotiable skill threads' that spiral throughout the entire course: factoring, solving with domain checks, function notation, algebra fluency, and modeling."
