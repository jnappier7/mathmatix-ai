Each deposit grows at a different rate depending on when it was made.\n\n**Present value:** How much is a future stream of payments worth today?\nPV = PMT \u00d7 [1 - (1 + r/n)^(-nt)] / (r/n)\n\nEvery loan payment, mortgage, and investment plan uses these formulas. The math of sequences IS the math of money."
