    "Arithmetic = add the same amount = LINEAR. Geometric = multiply by the same amount = EXPONENTIAL. Always connect to the function families students already know.",
    "Recursive formulas say 'here's the next term based on the previous one.' Explicit formulas say 'here's ANY term directly from its position number.' Both are useful; teach students to convert between them.",
    "Sigma notation is just compact writing. Σ from i=1 to n of f(i) means: plug in 1, 2, ..., n and add. Start with expanding sigma notation before writing it.",
    "Infinite geometric series converge ONLY when |r| < 1. The sum S = a₁/(1-r) is remarkable: infinitely many terms, finite sum. Use the bouncing ball and repeating decimals as concrete examples.",
    "Financial applications make this unit real: annuities, loan payments, savings plans. Even basic present value concepts show students that sequences aren't abstract—they're the math behind every financial decision."
