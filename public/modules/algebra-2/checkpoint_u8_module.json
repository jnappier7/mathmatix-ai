At its closest, the coastline is 200 meters from the lighthouse. (a) Write a function d(t) for the distance along the coastline from the nearest point to where the beam hits, as a function of time (use tangent). (b) At what time(s) during one revolution is the beam hitting the coastline at a point 200 meters from the nearest point? (c) Explain why this model breaks down when the beam is nearly parallel to the coastline.",

The geometry forms a right triangle where the adjacent side is 200 m and the opposite side is the distance d along the coast. d(t) = 200tan(πt/4). (b) d(t) = 200: 200 = 200tan(πt/4) → tan(πt/4) = 1 → πt/4 = π/4 → t = 1 second. By symmetry also at t = 8 - 1 = 7 seconds (beam returns from the other side). (c) When the beam approaches perpendicular to the nearest point line (θ near π/2), tan θ → ∞. Physically, the beam becomes nearly parallel to the coastline and the 'hit point' races to infinity. The model is undefined at t = 2 seconds (θ = π/2) and t = 6 seconds (θ = 3π/2).",
