    "State domain restrictions BEFORE simplifying. Every value that makes any denominator in the original expression equal to zero is excluded. Factors that cancel produce holes (removable discontinuities); factors that remain in the denominator produce vertical asymptotes.",

    "Extraneous solutions are the hallmark trap of rational equations. After clearing denominators and solving, ALWAYS substitute each candidate back into the original equation.
