    "State domain restrictions BEFORE simplifying. Every value that makes any denominator in the original expression equal to zero is excluded. Factors that cancel produce holes (removable discontinuities); factors that remain in the denominator produce vertical asymptotes.",
    "For addition and subtraction of rational expressions, factor every denominator first to identify the LCD. Build each fraction to the LCD, then combine numerators only. Never cross-multiply when adding — that technique is for equations and proportions, not sums.",
    "Extraneous solutions are the hallmark trap of rational equations. After clearing denominators and solving, ALWAYS substitute each candidate back into the original equation. If a candidate makes any denominator zero, it is extraneous and must be rejected. An equation can lose all candidates this way, resulting in 'no solution.'",
    "Asymptote analysis follows a clear algorithm: (1) Factor numerator and denominator completely, (2) cancel common factors to find holes, (3) set the remaining denominator equal to zero for vertical asymptotes, (4) compare degrees for the horizontal asymptote — same degree gives y = ratio of leading coefficients, numerator degree less gives y = 0, numerator degree greater means no HA."
