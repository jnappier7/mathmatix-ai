    "Begin with what students already know: right triangle trig from Geometry (SOH-CAH-TOA). The unit circle is NOT a new concept — it's what happens when the hypotenuse is always 1 and the triangle rotates around the origin.",
    "Degrees vs. radians: a radian is a ratio (arc length / radius), not an arbitrary unit. The key conversion: π rad = 180°. Students should internalize the common angles (30° = π/6, 45° = π/4, 60° = π/3, 90° = π/2) through repeated use, not memorization drills.",
    "The unit circle has only 5 key reference points in Q1 (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°). Symmetry gives you ALL other quadrants. Teach the pattern, not 16 separate facts: coordinates in Q1 use (√0/2, √1/2, √2/2, √3/2, √4/2) = (0, 1/2, √2/2, √3/2, 1) for sine values.",
    "For graphing sinusoidal functions, always identify the four transformations systematically: A = amplitude (vertical stretch), B determines period (2π/|B|), C/B = phase shift (horizontal), D = vertical shift (midline). Connect each parameter to a PHYSICAL meaning: amplitude = max displacement, period = time for one cycle.",
    "Inverse trig functions are about RESTRICTING the domain to get a function. sin⁻¹ lives on [-π/2, π/2], cos⁻¹ on [0, π], tan⁻¹ on (-π/2, π/2). Students must know these ranges — they determine which angle the calculator returns.",
    "When solving trig equations, find ALL solutions in the given interval. Use reference angles and quadrant analysis. Common mistake: finding only one solution when two (or more) exist in [0, 2π)."

Isolate the trig function (treat sin θ or cos θ like a variable)\n2. Find the reference angle using inverse trig\n3. Use quadrant analysis to find ALL solutions in the interval\n\n**Key principle:** Most trig equations have TWO solutions per period (except at max/min values).\n\n**Common patterns:**\n\n| Equation Form | Solutions in [0, 2π) |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| sin θ = k (k > 0) | θ = sin⁻¹(k) and θ = π - sin⁻¹(k) |\n| sin θ = k (k < 0) | θ = π - sin⁻¹(k) and θ = 2π + sin⁻¹(k) |\n| cos θ = k (k > 0) | θ = cos⁻¹(k) and θ = 2π - cos⁻¹(k) |\n| cos θ = k (k < 0) | θ = cos⁻¹(k) and θ = 2π - cos⁻¹(k) |\n| tan θ = k | θ = tan⁻¹(k) and θ = π + tan⁻¹(k) |\n\n**Equations reducible to quadratics:**\n2sin²θ - sin θ - 1 = 0 → let u = sin θ → 2u² - u - 1 = 0 → factor and solve.",
