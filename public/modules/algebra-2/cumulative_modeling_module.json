Does the quantity change by a constant AMOUNT? → Linear\n2. Does it change by a constant RATIO/PERCENT? → Exponential\n3. Does it have a maximum or minimum and symmetric shape? → Quadratic\n4. Does it repeat in cycles? → Trigonometric\n5. Does it grow quickly at first then flatten? → Logarithmic\n\n**Data clues:**\n- Constant first differences → Linear\n- Constant second differences → Quadratic\n- Constant ratios between consecutive terms → Exponential",
