Using numerical methods or graphing:\nThe concentration drops below 1 mg/L at approximately **t \u2248 9.2 hours**.\n\nWe can verify: C(9) = 12(9)e^(-3.6) = 108(0.0273) \u2248 2.95 (still above 1)\nC(10) = 12(10)e^(-4) = 120(0.0183) \u2248 2.20 (still above 1)\nC(12) = 12(12)e^(-4.8) = 144(0.00823) \u2248 1.18 (still above 1)\nC(14) = 12(14)e^(-5.6) = 168(0.00370) \u2248 0.62 (below 1)\n\nSo the concentration drops below 1 mg/L between t = 12 and t = 14 hours, approximately **t \u2248 13.2 hours**.",
