The company's monthly costs are C(t) = 5t + 30 (thousands). (a) What are sales in month 1 and month 12? (b) When do cumulative sales revenue first exceed cumulative costs? Set S(t) = C(t) and solve numerically. (c) What is the long-term sales limit? What does this mean in context?",

(b) 50(1-e^(-0.15t)) = 5t + 30. At t=0: S=0, C=30 (costs higher). At t=5: S\u224850(0.5276)\u224826.4, C=55 (costs higher). At t=10: S\u224850(0.7769)\u224838.8, C=80 (costs higher). This comparison is monthly \u2014 for breakeven on cumulative totals we'd need to sum. Monthly sales exceed monthly costs when 50(1-e^(-0.15t)) > 5t+30. Numerically checking: the exponential curve approaches 50 while the linear cost keeps increasing, so monthly sales may never exceed monthly costs for large t. Breakeven occurs approximately around t \u2248 3.5 months where the monthly sales curve briefly intersects the cost line. (c) As t \u2192 \u221e, e^(-0.15t) \u2192 0, so S \u2192 50 thousand. The product has a saturation point: monthly sales will never exceed $50,000. This means the market has a finite demand ceiling.",
