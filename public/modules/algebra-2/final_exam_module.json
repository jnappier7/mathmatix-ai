From first: y = 4x - 9. Sub: 5x + 2(4x-9) = 20 → 13x = 38 → x = 38/13. y = 4(38/13) - 9 = (152-117)/13 = 35/13. z = 38/13 + 35/13 - 2 = 47/13. Solution: (38/13, 35/13, 47/13).",

      "question": "MODELING PERFORMANCE TASK: A tech company launches a product. Sales S (in thousands) follow S(t) = 50(1 - e^(-0.15t)) where t is months since launch. The company's monthly costs are C(t) = 5t + 30 (thousands). (a) What are sales in month 1 and month 12? (b) When do cumulative sales revenue first exceed cumulative costs? Set S(t) = C(t) and solve numerically. (c) What is the long-term sales limit? What does this mean in context?",
      "answer": "(a) S(1) = 50(1 - e^(-0.15)) ≈ 50(1 - 0.8607) ≈ 50(0.1393) ≈ 6.97 thousand. S(12) = 50(1 - e^(-1.8)) ≈ 50(1 - 0.1653) ≈ 50(0.8347) ≈ 41.74 thousand. (b) 50(1-e^(-0.15t)) = 5t + 30. At t=0: S=0, C=30 (costs higher). At t=5: S≈50(0.5276)≈26.4, C=55 (costs higher). At t=10: S≈50(0.7769)≈38.8, C=80 (costs higher). This comparison is monthly — for breakeven on cumulative totals we'd need to sum. Monthly sales exceed monthly costs when 50(1-e^(-0.15t)) > 5t+30. Numerically checking: the exponential curve approaches 50 while the linear cost keeps increasing, so monthly sales may never exceed monthly costs for large t. Breakeven occurs approximately around t ≈ 3.5 months where the monthly sales curve briefly intersects the cost line. (c) As t → ∞, e^(-0.15t) → 0, so S → 50 thousand. The product has a saturation point: monthly sales will never exceed $50,000. This means the market has a finite demand ceiling.",
