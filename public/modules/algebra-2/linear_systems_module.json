    "Students saw basic substitution and elimination in Algebra 1. Now we extend to messier coefficients, three-variable systems, and special cases (no solution, infinitely many). Emphasize CHOOSING the most efficient method.",
    "Substitution is best when a variable is already isolated or has coefficient 1. Elimination is best when coefficients line up or are easy to scale. There's no single 'right method'—strategic thinking matters.",
    "Systems of inequalities: the solution is a REGION (shading), not a point. Test points confirm which side to shade. Emphasize the graphical interpretation—every point in the shaded region satisfies ALL inequalities simultaneously.",
    "Matrices are introduced as a tool, not an abstraction. Show the direct connection: matrix equation Ax = b mirrors the system. Inverse matrices 'undo' multiplication just like dividing undoes multiplying in a regular equation.",
    "Mathematical modeling is the payoff: real-world problems naturally produce systems. Students must write the system FROM the context, solve it, then interpret the answer IN context."
