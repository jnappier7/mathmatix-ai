    "Students saw quadratics in Algebra 1. The Algebra 2 approach goes DEEPER: every form reveals different information (standard → y-intercept, factored → x-intercepts, vertex → min/max), and the 'which method?' decision is the real skill.",
    "Completing the square is THE key technique of this unit—it derives the quadratic formula, converts to vertex form, and reappears in conic sections (Unit 8). If students can complete the square fluently, everything else follows.",
    "The discriminant (b²-4ac) is a diagnostic tool: positive → 2 real solutions, zero → 1 repeated, negative → 2 complex. Teach students to CHECK the discriminant BEFORE choosing a solving method.",
    "Complex numbers feel alien at first. Ground them in necessity: 'x² + 1 = 0 has no REAL solutions, so we invent a number system where it does.' The powers of i cycle: i, -1, -i, 1, repeat.",
    "For 'which method?' problems: factoring is fastest when it works; square root method for (x+a)² = b; completing the square always works and gives vertex form; quadratic formula is the universal fallback."
