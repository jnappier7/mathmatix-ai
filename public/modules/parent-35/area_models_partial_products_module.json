Area models and partial products break multiplication into visible, understandable pieces. This module explains exactly how these methods work, shows them side-by-side with the traditional algorithm, and explains why your child's teacher is building understanding before speed.",

      "text": "You remember multiplication looking like this:\n```\n    24\n  × 13\n  ----\n    72    (24 × 3)\n  240     (24 × 10)\n  ----\n  312\n```\n\nYour child's multiplication might look like this:\n```\n           20        4\n       ┌────────┬────────┐\n  10   │  200   │   40   │\n       ├────────┼────────┤\n   3   │   60   │   12   │\n       └────────┴────────┘\n\n200 + 40 + 60 + 12 = 312\n```\n\nSame answer. Very different process. And if you're thinking 'that looks like MORE work, not less'—you're right that it has more visible steps. But those visible steps are the point.\n\nThe area model makes every single partial product **visible**. Your child can SEE that 24 × 13 is really (20 × 10) + (4 × 10) + (20 × 3) + (4 × 3). The traditional algorithm does the same math but compresses it into a format that's efficient for adults who already understand it—and opaque for children who don't.\n\nThe area model is the training ground. The standard algorithm is the destination. Your child's teacher is building the road between them.",

      "title": "Why Not Just Teach the Standard Algorithm?",
      "text": "This is the question on every parent's mind. Here's the honest answer:\n\n**The standard algorithm IS taught.** Common Core standards explicitly require fluency with the standard algorithm for multiplication by the end of 5th grade. Your child WILL learn to multiply the way you learned.\n\n**But the standard algorithm is introduced later because:**\n\n**1. Understanding before speed.** Research shows that children who learn algorithms without understanding often can't tell when they've made an error. A child who uses partial products knows that 36 × 24 should be around 'about 30 × 25 = 750' and will catch a mistake. A child who only memorizes steps might not.\n\n**2. Place value is everything.** In the traditional algorithm, when you 'add a zero' on the second line, do you know WHY? It's because you're multiplying by the tens digit, so the result is in the tens place. Area models make this explicit. Children who understand place value make fewer errors and transition to the algorithm more smoothly.\n\n**3. It prevents 'math zombies.'** Dr. Jo Boaler (Stanford) coined this term for students who can execute procedures but can't explain what they mean. These students hit a wall when math requires reasoning (usually around Algebra 1).\n\n**4. It IS the math.** The distributive property (the rule behind partial products) is one of the most important ideas in all of mathematics. Your child is learning it now through multiplication. They'll use it in algebra, calculus, and beyond.\n\n**The timeline in most schools:**\n- 3rd grade: Conceptual strategies (arrays, repeated addition)\n- 4th grade: Area models and partial products\n- 5th grade: Standard algorithm (built on the understanding developed in 3rd–4th grade)\n\nBy 5th grade, your child will multiply the way you do—but they'll also understand WHY it works.",

There's nothing wrong with learning it early. But encourage them to also show their work using the method their teacher expects.
