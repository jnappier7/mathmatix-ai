      "answer": "The student is **incorrect**. In (x + 3)/(x + 5), the x is a **term** (connected by addition), not a **factor** (connected by multiplication). You can only cancel **factors**, not terms.\n\nDisproof by example: Let x = 2. The original expression gives (2 + 3)/(2 + 5) = 5/7, which is NOT equal to 3/5.\n\nThe expression (x + 3)/(x + 5) **cannot be simplified further** because the numerator and denominator share no common factors.\n\nExample where cancelling IS valid: x(x + 3)/(x(x + 5)) = (x + 3)/(x + 5), because x is a **factor** of both the numerator and denominator (it is multiplied, not added). We can cancel x because it is a common factor, leaving (x + 3)/(x + 5) with x \u2260 0.\n\n**The rule:** Factor completely first. Only expressions that appear as entire multiplicative factors in both the numerator and denominator can be cancelled. Individual terms within a sum cannot be cancelled.",
