      "text": "A **quadratic function** has the form **f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c**, where a \u2260 0. Its graph is a U-shaped curve called a **parabola**.\n\n**Key features of a parabola:**\n- **Vertex**: the highest or lowest point of the parabola. For f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is **x = -b / (2a)**, and the y-coordinate is found by plugging that x back in.\n- **Axis of symmetry**: the vertical line **x = -b / (2a)** that passes through the vertex. The parabola is a mirror image on either side.\n- **Direction of opening**: if **a > 0**, the parabola opens **upward** (like a cup \u2014 vertex is a minimum). If **a < 0**, the parabola opens **downward** (like a frown \u2014 vertex is a maximum).\n- **y-intercept**: the point where the graph crosses the y-axis, found by evaluating f(0) = c. So the y-intercept is always (0, c).\n- **x-intercepts** (also called **zeros** or **roots**): the points where f(x) = 0. A parabola can have 0, 1, or 2 x-intercepts.\n\n**Vertex form**: f(x) = a(x - h)\u00b2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. This form makes it easy to read the vertex directly.\n\n**Real-world examples:** The path of a thrown ball, the shape of a satellite dish, and the profit curve of a business are all modeled by quadratic functions.",
