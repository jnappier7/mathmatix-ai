      "content": "A **quadratic function** has the form **f(x) = ax² + bx + c**, where a ≠ 0. Its graph is a U-shaped curve called a **parabola**.\n\n**Key features of a parabola:**\n- **Vertex**: the highest or lowest point of the parabola. For f(x) = ax² + bx + c, the x-coordinate of the vertex is **x = -b / (2a)**, and the y-coordinate is found by plugging that x back in.\n- **Axis of symmetry**: the vertical line **x = -b / (2a)** that passes through the vertex. The parabola is a mirror image on either side.\n- **Direction of opening**: if **a > 0**, the parabola opens **upward** (like a cup — vertex is a minimum). If **a < 0**, the parabola opens **downward** (like a frown — vertex is a maximum).\n- **y-intercept**: the point where the graph crosses the y-axis, found by evaluating f(0) = c. So the y-intercept is always (0, c).\n- **x-intercepts** (also called **zeros** or **roots**): the points where f(x) = 0. A parabola can have 0, 1, or 2 x-intercepts.\n\n**Vertex form**: f(x) = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. This form makes it easy to read the vertex directly.\n\n**Real-world examples:** The path of a thrown ball, the shape of a satellite dish, and the profit curve of a business are all modeled by quadratic functions.",

The **quadratic formula** works for ALL quadratic equations ax² + bx + c = 0:\n\n**x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)**\n\nThis formula is derived by completing the square on the general equation ax² + bx + c = 0. It always works, regardless of whether the equation factors.\n\n**The discriminant** is the expression under the square root: **D = b² - 4ac**. It tells you the number and type of solutions before you finish solving:\n\n- **D > 0** (positive): **Two distinct real solutions.** The parabola crosses the x-axis at two points.\n- **D = 0** (zero): **One repeated real solution** (a double root). The parabola touches the x-axis at exactly one point (the vertex is on the x-axis).\n- **D < 0** (negative): **No real solutions.** The square root of a negative number is not real. The parabola does not cross the x-axis at all.\n\n**Tip:** Calculate the discriminant first. It tells you what kind of answers to expect and helps you avoid errors. If D is a perfect square, the equation could have been factored.",
