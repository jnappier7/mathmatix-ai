If pressing the same button sometimes gave you chips and sometimes gave you pretzels, the machine would be broken — and the relation would NOT be a function.\n\nWe describe functions using several tools:\n- **Domain**: the set of all possible inputs (x-values)\n- **Range**: the set of all possible outputs (y-values)\n- **Vertical Line Test**: if any vertical line crosses a graph more than once, the graph is NOT a function (one input is producing two outputs)\n- **f(x) notation**: instead of writing y, we write f(x) — read 'f of x' — to emphasize that the output depends on the input. For example, if f(x) = 2x + 3, then f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11.\n\nEvery function can be represented as a set of ordered pairs, a mapping diagram, a table, a graph, or an equation.",

We calculate slope as:\n\n**m = rise / run = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)**\n\nSlope comes in four types:\n- **Positive slope**: line goes up from left to right (like climbing a hill)\n- **Negative slope**: line goes down from left to right (like going downhill)\n- **Zero slope**: horizontal line (flat road — no rise, y does not change)\n- **Undefined slope**: vertical line (a cliff — no run, x does not change, division by zero)\n\nIn real-world contexts, slope represents a **rate of change**. For example, if a plumber charges $50 per hour, the slope of the cost-vs-hours graph is 50 — for every additional hour, the cost rises by $50.\n\nTo visualize slope on a graph, draw a **slope triangle**: from one point on the line, count the vertical change (rise) and the horizontal change (run) to reach another point on the line.",
