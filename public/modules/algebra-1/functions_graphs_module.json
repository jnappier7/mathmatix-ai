If pressing the same button sometimes gave you chips and sometimes gave you pretzels, the machine would be broken — and the relation would NOT be a function.\n\nWe describe functions using several tools:\n- **Domain**: the set of all possible inputs (x-values)\n- **Range**: the set of all possible outputs (y-values)\n- **Vertical Line Test**: if any vertical line crosses a graph more than once, the graph is NOT a function (one input is producing two outputs)\n- **f(x) notation**: instead of writing y, we write f(x) — read 'f of x' — to emphasize that the output depends on the input. For example, if f(x) = 2x + 3, then f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11.\n\nEvery function can be represented as a set of ordered pairs, a mapping diagram, a table, a graph, or an equation.",
