      "question": "ANALYSIS: A student claims that y = 500·(0.95)ˣ will eventually reach zero and become negative. Is the student correct? Explain your reasoning using the properties of exponential functions, and describe what happens to the graph as x increases without bound.",
      "answer": "The student is **incorrect**. The function y = 500·(0.95)ˣ will never reach zero and will never become negative.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1. The base b = 0.95 is positive (0 < 0.95 < 1). Any positive number raised to any power is always positive: (0.95)ˣ > 0 for all x.\n2. Multiplying by 500 (a positive number) keeps the result positive: y = 500·(0.95)ˣ > 0 for all x.\n3. As x → ∞, (0.95)ˣ → 0 but never equals 0. The values get closer and closer to zero (e.g., at x = 100, y ≈ 500·0.00592 ≈ 2.96; at x = 200, y ≈ 500·0.0000351 ≈ 0.0176) but remain positive.\n4. The horizontal asymptote is **y = 0**. The graph approaches the x-axis but never touches or crosses it.\n5. The range of this function is y > 0 — all positive real numbers.\n\nThe student may have confused exponential decay with linear decrease. A linear function like y = 500 - 25x does eventually reach zero (at x = 20) and become negative. But exponential decay loses a percentage of what remains, and a percentage of a positive number is always positive, so the function can never reach zero.",
