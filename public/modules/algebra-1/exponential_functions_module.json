Difference is always +$50.\n\n**Exponential functions** (y = a·bˣ):\n- Have a **constant percent change** (constant ratio).\n- When x increases by 1, y is **multiplied by the same factor** (the base b) every time.\n- In a table, the **ratios** between consecutive y-values are equal.\n- Graph: a **curve** that either rises faster and faster (growth) or falls slower and slower (decay).\n- Example: Investment growing 10% per year. After 1 year: $110, 2 years: $121, 3 years: $133.10. Ratio is always ×1.10.\n\n**Key comparison:** For large x, exponential growth **always** eventually overtakes linear growth, no matter how steep the line or how slow the exponential base. A function growing by 1% per step will eventually surpass a function growing by adding 1,000,000 per step — it just takes a very long time.\n\n**How to identify from a table:**\n1. Check the **differences** between consecutive y-values. If constant → linear.\n2. Check the **ratios** between consecutive y-values. If constant → exponential.\n3. If neither is constant, the function may be neither linear nor exponential.",
