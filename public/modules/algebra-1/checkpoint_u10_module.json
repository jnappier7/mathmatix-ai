      "answer": "The student is **incorrect**. √(a² + b²) ≠ a + b in general.\n\n**Disproof by counterexample:** Let a = 3, b = 4.\nStudent's claim: √(3² + 4²) = 3 + 4 = 7.\nActual value: √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.\nSince 5 ≠ 7, the claim is **false**.\n\n**Why it fails:** The square root does not distribute over addition. √(a² + b²) ≠ √(a²) + √(b²). The product property says √(ab) = √a · √b (roots distribute over multiplication), but there is NO equivalent property for addition: √(a + b) ≠ √a + √b.\n\n**Connection to the Pythagorean theorem:** √(a² + b²) is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs a and b. The hypotenuse is always **shorter** than the sum of the two legs (a + b), because the straight-line path (hypotenuse) is shorter than going along two sides of the triangle. This is an instance of the **triangle inequality**: the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side, so a + b > c = √(a² + b²).\n\nThe only case where √(a² + b²) = a + b would be if one of the values were 0 (e.g., a = 0: √(0 + b²) = √(b²) = b = 0 + b).",
