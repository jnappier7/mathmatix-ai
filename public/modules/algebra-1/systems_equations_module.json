For a system of two linear equations in two unknowns, we are looking for values of x and y that make BOTH equations true at the same time.\n\n**Graphically:** Each linear equation is a line. The **solution** to the system is the point where the two lines **intersect** — the one (x, y) pair that lies on both lines.\n\n**Three possible outcomes:**\n- **One solution:** The lines intersect at exactly one point (most common). The system is *consistent and independent*.\n- **No solution:** The lines are parallel — they never intersect. The system is *inconsistent*. You will get a false statement like 0 = 5.\n- **Infinitely many solutions:** The lines are the same line (they overlap completely). The system is *consistent and dependent*.

      "content": "A **system of inequalities** involves two or more inequalities graphed on the same coordinate plane. The solution is the **overlap region** — the set of all points that satisfy ALL inequalities at the same time.\n\n**How to graph a system of inequalities:**\n1. **Graph each inequality separately** (boundary line + shading)\n   - Solid line for ≤ or ≥; dashed line for < or >\n   - Use a test point to determine which side to shade\n2. **Identify the overlap** — the region where ALL shadings intersect\n3. **The solution region** is where all conditions are met simultaneously\n\n**Key differences from systems of equations:**\n- A system of equations usually has one point as a solution\n- A system of inequalities has a whole REGION of solutions (infinitely many points)\n\n**Real-world context:** Systems of inequalities define **feasible regions** — for example, budget constraints (can't spend more than $100) combined with quantity constraints (need at least 5 items) create a region of valid choices.",
