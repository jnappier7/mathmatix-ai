For a system of two linear equations in two unknowns, we are looking for values of x and y that make BOTH equations true at the same time.\n\n**Graphically:** Each linear equation is a line. The **solution** to the system is the point where the two lines **intersect**—the one (x, y) pair that lies on both lines.\n\n**Three possible outcomes:**\n- **One solution:** The lines intersect at exactly one point (most common). The system is *consistent and independent*.\n- **No solution:** The lines are parallel—they never intersect. The system is *inconsistent*. You will get a false statement like 0 = 5.\n- **Infinitely many solutions:** The lines are the same line (they overlap completely). The system is *consistent and dependent*. You will get a true statement like 0 = 0.\n\nTo solve by graphing: graph both equations on the same coordinate plane, then read the intersection point. Always verify by substituting back into BOTH equations.",

Hmm, let's recheck: 3s = 44 → s = 44/3 ≈ 14.67. Actually using whole numbers: s + L = 52 and L = 2s + 8, so s + 2s + 8 = 52 → 3s = 44 → s = 44/3. The problem works with s = 44/3 and L = 52 - 44/3 = 112/3. Verify: 44/3 + 112/3 = 156/3 = 52 ✓ and 112/3 = 2(44/3) + 8 = 88/3 + 24/3 = 112/3 ✓.

Adjusting: actually 4n + 2(n+3) = 26 → 6n + 6 = 26 → 6n = 20 → n = 20/6 = 10/3. With the constraint of whole items: n = 3, p = 6 → 4(3)+2(6) = 12+12 = 24 ≠ 26. n = 4, p = 7 → 4(4)+2(7) = 16+14 = 30 ≠ 26. Revised problem: The customer spends $30 → 6n + 6 = 30 → n = 4, p = 7.
