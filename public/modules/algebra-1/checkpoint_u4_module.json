      "question": "Solve by elimination (multiply first):\n4x + 3y = 22\n5x - 2y = 2",
      "answer": "Multiply equation 1 by 2 and equation 2 by 3 to eliminate y: 8x + 6y = 44 and 15x - 6y = 6. Add: 23x = 50 → x = 50/23. Alternatively, eliminate x: multiply equation 1 by 5 and equation 2 by 4: 20x + 15y = 110 and 20x - 8y = 8. Subtract: 23y = 102 → y = 102/23. Let's use cleaner elimination: multiply eq 1 by 2: 8x + 6y = 44. Multiply eq 2 by 3: 15x - 6y = 6. Add: 23x = 50 → x = 50/23 ≈ 2.17. Then 4(50/23) + 3y = 22 → 200/23 + 3y = 22 → 3y = 22 - 200/23 = (506 - 200)/23 = 306/23 → y = 102/23 ≈ 4.43. Solution: (50/23, 102/23). Verify: 4(50/23) + 3(102/23) = 200/23 + 306/23 = 506/23 = 22 ✓ and 5(50/23) - 2(102/23) = 250/23 - 204/23 = 46/23 = 2 ✓.",

Both variables canceled and we got a contradiction, so the system has **no solution**. The system is **inconsistent**.

Substitute: 12a + 7(350 - a) = 3300 → 12a + 2450 - 7a = 3300 → 5a = 850 → a = 170. Then c = 350 - 170 = 180. Verify: 170 + 180 = 350 ✓ and 12(170) + 7(180) = 2040 + 1260 = 3300 ✓. **Answer: 170 adult tickets and 180 child tickets.**",

Substitute: 2(54 - w) + 4w = 140 → 108 - 2w + 4w = 140 → 2w = 32 → w = 16. Then c = 54 - 16 = 38. Verify: 38 + 16 = 54 heads ✓ and 2(38) + 4(16) = 76 + 64 = 140 legs ✓. **Answer: 38 chickens and 16 cows.**",

      "answer": "The student is **incorrect**. Multiply equation 1 by 2: 10x + 4y = 16. This is identical to equation 2. Subtracting: 0 = 0, a true statement. The system has **infinitely many solutions**, not no solution. The system is **consistent and dependent**. Both equations represent the same line: 5x + 2y = 8, or equivalently y = -5x/2 + 4. Graphically, the two equations produce the **exact same line** — they overlap completely. Every point on this line (there are infinitely many) is a solution. The student likely confused 'same line' (infinitely many solutions, 0 = 0) with 'parallel lines' (no solution, 0 = nonzero). The key distinction: if both variables cancel and you get a TRUE statement → same line; if you get a FALSE statement → parallel lines.",
