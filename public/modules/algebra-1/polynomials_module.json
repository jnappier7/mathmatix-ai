Product Rule:** aᵐ · aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ\nWhen you multiply powers with the **same base**, ADD the exponents.\nWhy? x³ · x⁴ = (x·x·x)(x·x·x·x) = x⁷ — that is 3 + 4 = 7 factors of x.\n\n**2. Quotient Rule:** aᵐ / aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ (a ≠ 0)\nWhen you divide powers with the **same base**, SUBTRACT the exponents.\nWhy? x⁵ / x² = (x·x·x·x·x) / (x·x) — two factors cancel, leaving x³ = x⁵⁻².\n\n**3. Power Rule:** (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ\nWhen you raise a power to another power, MULTIPLY the exponents.\nWhy? (x²)³ = x² · x² · x² = x⁶ = x²ˣ³.\n\n**4. Zero Exponent Rule:** a⁰ = 1 (a ≠ 0)\nAny nonzero base raised to the zero power equals 1.\nWhy? aⁿ / aⁿ = aⁿ⁻ⁿ = a⁰, but aⁿ / aⁿ is also 1, so a⁰ = 1.\n\n**5. Negative Exponent Rule:** a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ (a ≠ 0)\nA negative exponent means 'take the reciprocal.'\nWhy? a⁻ⁿ = a⁰⁻ⁿ = a⁰ / aⁿ = 1/aⁿ.\n\n**Important:** These rules only apply when the bases are the **same**.
