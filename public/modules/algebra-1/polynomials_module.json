      "content": "An **exponent** tells you how many times a base is used as a factor: x\u2074 = x\u00b7x\u00b7x\u00b7x.\n\nHere are the five core exponent rules you need:\n\n**1. Product Rule:** a\u1d50 \u00b7 a\u207f = a\u1d50\u207a\u207f\nWhen you multiply powers with the **same base**, ADD the exponents.\nWhy? x\u00b3 \u00b7 x\u2074 = (x\u00b7x\u00b7x)(x\u00b7x\u00b7x\u00b7x) = x\u2077 \u2014 that is 3 + 4 = 7 factors of x.\n\n**2. Quotient Rule:** a\u1d50 / a\u207f = a\u1d50\u207b\u207f (a \u2260 0)\nWhen you divide powers with the **same base**, SUBTRACT the exponents.\nWhy? x\u2075 / x\u00b2 = (x\u00b7x\u00b7x\u00b7x\u00b7x) / (x\u00b7x) \u2014 two factors cancel, leaving x\u00b3 = x\u2075\u207b\u00b2.\n\n**3. Power Rule:** (a\u1d50)\u207f = a\u1d50\u207f\nWhen you raise a power to another power, MULTIPLY the exponents.\nWhy? (x\u00b2)\u00b3 = x\u00b2 \u00b7 x\u00b2 \u00b7 x\u00b2 = x\u2076 = x\u00b2\u02e3\u00b3.\n\n**4. Zero Exponent Rule:** a\u2070 = 1 (a \u2260 0)\nAny nonzero base raised to the zero power equals 1.\nWhy? a\u207f / a\u207f = a\u207f\u207b\u207f = a\u2070, but a\u207f / a\u207f is also 1, so a\u2070 = 1.\n\n**5. Negative Exponent Rule:** a\u207b\u207f = 1/a\u207f (a \u2260 0)\nA negative exponent means 'take the reciprocal.'\nWhy? a\u207b\u207f = a\u2070\u207b\u207f = a\u2070 / a\u207f = 1/a\u207f.\n\n**Important:** These rules only apply when the bases are the **same**. You cannot use the product rule to simplify x\u00b3 \u00b7 y\u00b2 because the bases (x and y) are different.",
