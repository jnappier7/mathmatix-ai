Find the **largest perfect square factor** of the number under the radical.\n2. Rewrite the radical as a product of two square roots.\n3. Simplify the perfect square root.\n\n**Example:** √72 = √(36 · 2) = √36 · √2 = 6√2\n\n**Variables under radicals:** For variables with even exponents, use √(x²) = |x| (or simply x when x ≥ 0):\n√(x⁴) = x², √(x⁶) = x³, √(25x²) = 5x (assuming x ≥ 0).\n\n**Adding and subtracting radicals:** You can only combine radicals with the **same radicand** (the expression under the radical sign).
