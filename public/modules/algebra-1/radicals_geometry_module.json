      "content": "A **radical expression** contains a root symbol (\u221a). The most common radical is the **square root**.\n\n**Square root definition:** \u221aa is the non-negative number whose square is a.

Find the **largest perfect square factor** of the number under the radical.\n2. Rewrite the radical as a product of two square roots.\n3. Simplify the perfect square root.\n\n**Example:** \u221a72 = \u221a(36 \u00b7 2) = \u221a36 \u00b7 \u221a2 = 6\u221a2\n\n**Variables under radicals:** For variables with even exponents, use \u221a(x\u00b2) = |x| (or simply x when x \u2265 0):\n\u221a(x\u2074) = x\u00b2, \u221a(x\u2076) = x\u00b3, \u221a(25x\u00b2) = 5x (assuming x \u2265 0).\n\n**Adding and subtracting radicals:** You can only combine radicals with the **same radicand** (the expression under the radical sign). These are called **like radicals**, similar to like terms:\n3\u221a5 + 7\u221a5 = 10\u221a5 (same radicand \u221a5)\n4\u221a2 \u2212 \u221a2 = 3\u221a2 (same radicand \u221a2)\n3\u221a2 + 4\u221a3 cannot be combined (different radicands)",
