An **algebraic expression** combines numbers, variables, and operations (like +, -, x, /) without an equals sign.\n\nTranslating words into algebra is one of the most important skills you'll learn:\n- \"5 more than a number\" becomes **x + 5**\n- \"Twice a number\" becomes **2x**\n- \"A number decreased by 7\" becomes **x - 7**\n- \"The product of 4 and a number, increased by 3\" becomes **4x + 3**\n\nTo **evaluate** an expression means to substitute a given value for the variable and compute the result.
