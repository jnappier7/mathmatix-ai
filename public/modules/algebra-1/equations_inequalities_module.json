      "content": "An **equation** is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, connected by the equals sign (=). Think of it like a balanced scale: the left side weighs the same as the right side.\n\nOur goal when solving an equation is to find the value of the variable that makes the statement true. That value is called the **solution**.\n\nWe solve equations using two key ideas:\n- **Opposites make zero**: +7 and -7 are opposites \u2014 they cancel to zero\n- **Side by side, divide**: when a number is multiplied by the variable, divide it out\n\nThe golden rule: **Equations MUST always stay equal** \u2014 whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other side.\n\nTo **check** a solution, substitute it back into the original equation and verify both sides are equal. For example, if we claim x = 8 is the solution to x + 7 = 15, we check: 8 + 7 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f.",

But there is one critical difference:\n\n**When you multiply or divide both sides by a NEGATIVE number, you must FLIP the inequality sign.**\n\nWhy? Consider: 2 < 5 is true.
