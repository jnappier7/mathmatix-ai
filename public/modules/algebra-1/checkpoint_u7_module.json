Range = 31 − 10 = 21. The mean (18.9) and median (18) are close, indicating the data is roughly symmetric without extreme outliers.

This shows the mean is sensitive to outliers while the median is resistant. The median (80) better represents the typical student's score after including the outlier.",

(c) Lower fence = Q1 − 1.5(IQR) = 55 − 1.5(19) = 55 − 28.5 = 26.5. Since 25 < 26.5, yes, a value of 25 would be considered an outlier.

Team B has a higher median (70 vs. 67), so Team B scores higher on average. Team B is also more consistent: its IQR (11) is smaller than Team A's (18), and its range (30) is smaller than Team A's (43).

      "answer": "As absences increase (0→7), exam scores decrease (95→50). This is a **strong negative correlation** — the points closely follow a downward trend. This likely reflects a **causal** relationship: missing class means missing instruction, practice, and review, which directly leads to lower exam performance. However, lurking variables may also contribute — students who miss more class may also be less motivated, have health issues, or face other barriers. While the causal link between attendance and learning is well-supported by research, a controlled experiment would be needed to fully establish causation.",

      "answer": "Slope: m = (50 − 95)/(7 − 0) = −45/7 ≈ −6.43. Using (0, 95): 95 = −6.43(0) + b → b = 95. Equation: **y = −6.43x + 95**. Prediction at x = 3: y = −6.43(3) + 95 = −19.29 + 95 = **75.71 ≈ 76**. The actual data point at x = 3 is 78, so our prediction is close (off by about 2 points). This is **interpolation** because 3 is within the data range (0 to 7), making the prediction reliable. The slope of −6.43 means that each additional absence is associated with approximately a 6.4-point decrease in the exam score.",

      "answer": "The reporter is confusing **correlation with causation**. Ice cream trucks do not cause sunburn. The **lurking variable** is **hot, sunny weather**. During summer and on hot days, more ice cream trucks operate (because demand for ice cream rises), and more people spend time outdoors in the sun (leading to more sunburns). Both variables — ice cream truck activity and sunburn rates — increase due to the same underlying cause (sunny, hot weather), creating a positive correlation. But one does not cause the other. To establish causation, you would need a controlled experiment, which is clearly impractical here. This is a classic example of why **correlation does not imply causation**.",

Alternatively, non-green = 3 + 4 = 7, so P(not green) = 7/10. (c) With replacement, the draws are independent.

The student uses points (5, 60) and (10, 92) to write the line of best fit y = 6.4x + 28. The student then predicts that a person who sleeps 20 hours will score 156 on the quiz. Explain why this prediction is flawed, calculate what the line predicts for someone who sleeps 7.5 hours, and state whether that prediction is more trustworthy.",
      "answer": "**Why the 20-hour prediction is flawed:**\nThe prediction y = 6.4(20) + 28 = 156 is **extrapolation** far beyond the data range (5 to 10 hours). It is unreliable for two reasons: (1) It is physically impossible to sleep 20 hours and take a quiz in the same day. (2) A score of 156 exceeds the maximum possible quiz score (typically 100). The linear trend does not hold indefinitely — there are diminishing returns, and both sleep and scores have natural limits.\n\n**Prediction for 7.5 hours:**\ny = 6.4(7.5) + 28 = 48 + 28 = **76**.\nChecking against the data: at x = 7, score = 75 and at x = 8, score = 85. The prediction of 76 for 7.5 hours falls between these values and is reasonable.\n\n**Is it more trustworthy?**\nYes, this is **interpolation** (7.5 is within the data range of 5 to 10), so the prediction is much more reliable than extrapolating to 20 hours. The data supports a linear trend in this region, and the predicted score of 76 is plausible and consistent with surrounding data points.\n\n**Key lesson:** Lines of best fit are useful tools for prediction, but only within or near the range of the original data. Extrapolating far beyond the data can produce absurd or impossible results.",
