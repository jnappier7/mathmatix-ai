The direction of opening (determined by the sign of a) does NOT determine the number of real solutions \u2014 the discriminant does.\n\nCompute the discriminant: a = 2, b = -4, c = 5. D = (-4)\u00b2 - 4(2)(5) = 16 - 40 = **-24**.\n\nSince D < 0, the equation has **no real solutions**. The parabola y = 2x\u00b2 - 4x + 5 opens upward (a = 2 > 0), but its vertex is above the x-axis \u2014 the entire parabola sits above the x-axis and never crosses it.\n\nFinding the vertex confirms this: x = -(-4)/(2\u00b72) = 1, y = 2(1) - 4(1) + 5 = 3. The vertex is (1, 3), which is above the x-axis. Since the parabola opens upward from a vertex at y = 3, it never reaches y = 0.\n\nThe student confused the direction of opening with the existence of real roots. A parabola that opens upward can have 0, 1, or 2 x-intercepts depending on where its vertex is relative to the x-axis.",
