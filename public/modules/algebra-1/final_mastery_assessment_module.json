  "description": "Comprehensive final assessment covering all 10 units of Algebra 1. This summative evaluation measures mastery across the full scope of the course: foundations of algebra and simplifying expressions (Unit 1), solving equations and inequalities (Unit 2), linear functions and graphing (Unit 3), systems of equations (Unit 4), polynomials and factoring (Unit 5), quadratic functions and the quadratic formula (Unit 6), data analysis and probability (Unit 7), exponential functions (Unit 8), rational expressions (Unit 9), and radicals and geometry connections (Unit 10). Students must demonstrate fluency with algebraic procedures, conceptual understanding of function families, and the ability to apply mathematical reasoning to real-world contexts.",

Although it starts slower than both linear and quadratic, it will eventually surpass the linear model because exponential growth always overtakes linear growth given enough time. At 8% growth, Student B will overtake Student A around year 20.\n\nThe **quadratic model (Student C)** is **unrealistic** for long-term savings. Because the leading coefficient is negative (a = \u221250), the parabola opens downward and the balance eventually becomes negative (h(15) = \u2212$1,250). An account balance cannot be negative in this context. The quadratic model reaches a maximum at x = \u2212600/(2\u00b7(\u221250)) = 6 years, then decreases. While it performs well in the short term (best at 5 years), it fails completely over time. Real savings accounts do not behave this way.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Linear growth adds a fixed amount, exponential growth multiplies by a fixed factor, and quadratic growth rises then falls (when a < 0). For modeling money that grows over time, exponential functions are the most realistic because they capture the compounding effect of interest.",
