These are called **measures of central tendency**.\n\n**Mean (average):** Add all values and divide by the number of values.\nFormula: mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)\n\n**Median:** The middle value when data is arranged in order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n\n**Mode:** The value that appears most frequently. A data set can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode (if all values appear the same number of times).\n\n**Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values. Range = max \u2212 min. It measures the spread of the data.\n\n**Outliers and their effects:**\nAn **outlier** is a data value that is significantly higher or lower than the rest. Outliers have a large effect on the **mean** (they pull it toward the outlier), but they have little or no effect on the **median** (since the median depends on position, not value). This is why the median is often called a **resistant** measure \u2014 it resists the influence of extreme values.\n\n**When to use which measure:**\n- Use the **mean** when data is roughly symmetric with no extreme outliers.\n- Use the **median** when data is skewed or has outliers (e.g., income data, home prices).\n- Use the **mode** when you want the most common value (e.g., most popular shoe size).",
