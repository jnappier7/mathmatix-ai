  "description": "The highest-weighted unit on the AP Calculus AB exam (17-20%). Students learn to interpret the definite integral as accumulated change, approximate integrals using Riemann sums and trapezoidal sums, connect differentiation and integration through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Parts 1 and 2), compute antiderivatives using power rule reversal, standard formulas, and u-substitution, and apply properties of definite integrals. Weekly rhythm includes both MCQ drills and FRQ sets emphasizing interpretation of integrals in applied contexts.",
