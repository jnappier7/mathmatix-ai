Students learn to sketch and interpret slope fields, solve separable differential equations to find general and particular solutions, and model real-world scenarios using exponential growth and decay. This unit bridges derivatives and integrals: a differential equation states a relationship involving dy/dx, and solving it means undoing the derivative via integration. Weekly rhythm includes FRQ-style differential equation problems mirroring the AP exam format (6-12% of exam weight).",
