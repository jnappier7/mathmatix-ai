  "description": "Students develop the formal definition of the derivative as the limit of the difference quotient, interpret the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, and establish conditions for differentiability versus continuity. They then build a toolkit of basic differentiation rules — power, product, quotient, and sum/difference — along with common derivatives for trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. The unit closes with reading and estimating derivatives from graphs and tables, a skill heavily tested on the AP exam. Weekly rhythm includes AP-style FRQ derivative problems.",
