          "solution": "Yes, this is a valid random sampling method called systematic sampling. As long as the alphabetical list has no hidden pattern related to recess preferences (and it wouldn't — last names are unrelated to opinions about recess), every student has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThe method produces 600 / 10 = 60 students, which is the desired sample size.

          "solution": "Difference in means: 13 - 12 = 1 cm.\nThe MADs are 3 cm and 4 cm, so the typical variation within each group is 3 to 4 cm.\n\nThe 1 cm difference between the groups is much smaller than the variability within each group. This means the difference could easily be due to natural variation in plant growth rather than a real difference between the fertilizers.\n\nInference: There is not enough evidence to conclude that one fertilizer works better than the other. The difference in means (1 cm) is small compared to the MADs (3-4 cm), so it could just be sampling variability."

It is right at the boundary — the difference is about the same size as the variability within each group.\n\nInference: There is some evidence that track team runners tend to have faster mile times than soccer team runners, but the evidence is not overwhelming. The difference (0.8 min) is close to the typical variation within each team (0.6 to 0.8 min), so additional data would help strengthen this conclusion."

Here are 5 randomly selected scores from each class.\n\nMs. Rivera's class: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90\nMr. Chen's class: 76, 78, 80, 82, 84\n\nCompute the mean, median, range, and MAD for each class. Then write 2-3 sentences comparing the two classes.",
          "answer": "Ms. Rivera's class: Mean = (70+75+80+85+90)/5 = 400/5 = 80. Median = 80. Range = 90-70 = 20. MAD = (|70-80|+|75-80|+|80-80|+|85-80|+|90-80|)/5 = (10+5+0+5+10)/5 = 30/5 = 6.\n\nMr. Chen's class: Mean = (76+78+80+82+84)/5 = 400/5 = 80. Median = 80. Range = 84-76 = 8. MAD = (|76-80|+|78-80|+|80-80|+|82-80|+|84-80|)/5 = (4+2+0+2+4)/5 = 12/5 = 2.4.\n\nBoth classes have the same mean and median of 80, so the typical performance is identical. However, Mr. Chen's class is much more consistent — the range (8 vs 20) and MAD (2.4 vs 6) are both smaller. Ms. Rivera's class has a wider spread of scores, with some students scoring much higher and some much lower than the average."

          "answer": "Player A: Mean = (6+7+8+7+7)/5 = 35/5 = 7. Sorted: 6, 7, 7, 7, 8. Median = 7. Range = 8-6 = 2. MAD = (|6-7|+|7-7|+|8-7|+|7-7|+|7-7|)/5 = (1+0+1+0+0)/5 = 2/5 = 0.4.\n\nPlayer B: Mean = (4+9+5+10+7)/5 = 35/5 = 7. Sorted: 4, 5, 7, 9, 10. Median = 7. Range = 10-4 = 6.

Player A's range is only 2 (compared to 6) and MAD is only 0.4 (compared to 2), meaning Player A makes very close to 7 free throws every session. Player B is unpredictable — sometimes making as few as 4 and as many as 10."

A random sample of 25 students from Hilltop Middle School spent a mean of 60 minutes per night with a MAD of 8 minutes. Draw an informal inference comparing the homework habits of students at these two schools. Justify your answer using the data.",
          "answer": "The difference in means is 60 - 45 = 15 minutes. The MADs are 10 minutes (Riverside) and 8 minutes (Hilltop), so the typical variation within each school is about 8 to 10 minutes. The 15-minute difference between the schools is larger than the variation within either school, which suggests the difference is real and not just due to sampling variability. Inference: Students at Hilltop Middle School likely spend more time on homework per night than students at Riverside Middle School."
