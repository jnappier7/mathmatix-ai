Start by computing and comparing unit rates, then set up and solve proportions in real-world contexts like cooking and shopping. Explore scale drawings and maps using proportional reasoning. Finish by applying percent concepts to discounts, tax, tips, markups, and percent change — including the surprising result when you increase and then decrease by the same percent.",

      "content": "A **ratio** compares two quantities (e.g., 3 wins to 2 losses, written 3:2). A **rate** is a special ratio that compares two quantities with *different* units — like miles per hour or dollars per pound. A **unit rate** is a rate with a denominator of 1. It answers the question: 'How much of the first quantity for every ONE of the second?'\n\nTo find a unit rate, divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, if you earn $45 for 6 hours of work, the unit rate is $45 / 6 = $7.50 per hour.\n\nUnit rates let you make fair comparisons. If one store sells 5 apples for $4.00 and another sells 3 apples for $2.25, you cannot compare directly — the quantities are different. But compute the price per apple ($0.80 vs. $0.75) and the comparison is instant.",

      "content": "A **proportion** is an equation stating that two ratios are equal: a/b = c/d. You can read it as 'a is to b as c is to d.' Proportions are the bridge between a known ratio and an unknown quantity.\n\nTo solve a proportion, use **cross-multiplication**: multiply the numerator of each fraction by the denominator of the other. If a/b = c/d, then a * d = b * c. Then solve the resulting one-step equation.\n\nFor example, if a recipe uses 2 cups of rice for 5 servings, and you need 8 servings, set up 2/5 = x/8. Cross-multiply: 5x = 16, so x = 16/5 = 3.2 cups of rice.\n\nProportional reasoning appears everywhere: scaling recipes, converting currencies, predicting outcomes from samples, and much more.",

To find a drawing measurement from a real measurement, divide by the scale factor.\n\nMaps work the same way. If a map says '1 inch = 20 miles' and two cities are 3.5 inches apart on the map, the actual distance is 3.5 * 20 = 70 miles.\n\nYou can also set up a proportion: (drawing measurement)/(actual measurement) = (scale drawing unit)/(scale actual unit).",

Percent increase = (10 / 40) * 100% = 25%.\n\n**Important surprise:** A percent increase followed by the *same* percent decrease does NOT bring you back to the original number. Why?
