Learn to identify whether two quantities are proportional by checking for a constant ratio, find the constant of proportionality (unit rate), write equations in the form y = kx, and graph proportional relationships as straight lines through the origin. Real-world contexts like speed, pricing, recipes, and wages bring these ideas to life.",
