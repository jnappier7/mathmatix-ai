This boot camp targets the five 6th-grade foundation skills that 7th graders MUST have on autopilot: integer operations, fraction/decimal fluency, simplifying expressions, solving one- and two-step equations, and coordinate plane basics. Diagnostic-first: assess before reteaching, skip what's solid, hammer what's shaky. Every gap left here will cascade into ratios, proportions, and linear relationships all year.",

    "This is NOT a reteach of 6th grade — it's a fast-paced diagnostic boot camp. Assess FIRST, then target gaps. Students who demonstrate fluency move quickly; students with gaps get focused mini-reteach.",
    "Integer operations are the #1 skill that breaks 7th-grade math. If a student can't handle -3 - (-7) on autopilot, proportional reasoning and slope will be impossible. Diagnose and fix immediately.",
    "Fraction/decimal fluency must be automatic — not calculator-dependent. Students who can't add fractions by hand will drown in 7.RP (ratios and proportional relationships).",
    "Simplifying expressions is the bridge between arithmetic and algebra. Distributive property errors and like-term confusion must be caught NOW before inequalities and two-variable equations build on them.",
    "Use real-world contexts (money, temperature, sports stats, cooking) to make abstract operations concrete. These students are 12-13 — keep it relevant.",
    "Coordinate plane fluency sets up ALL graphing for the rest of the year. Quadrant signs, reflections, and distance must be solid before proportional graphs appear."
