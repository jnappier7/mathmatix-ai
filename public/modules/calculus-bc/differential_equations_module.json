The simplest first-order form is:\n\ndy/dx = f(x, y)\n\nThis tells you the slope of the solution curve at every point (x, y). The solution is a function y(x) whose derivative matches the rule.\n\n**Slope Fields (Direction Fields):**\n\nAt each point (x, y) in the plane, draw a short line segment with slope f(x, y). The resulting picture is a slope field. Solution curves thread through the field, always tangent to the segments.\n\n**Reading a Slope field:**\n• Where segments are horizontal → dy/dx = 0 (these are the nullclines).\n• Where segments are steep → |dy/dx| is large.\n• Segments with the same slope lie along curves called isoclines.\n\n**General vs. Particular Solutions:**\n• **General solution:** The family of all solutions, containing an arbitrary constant C.\n  Example: dy/dx = 2x → y = x² + C (family of parabolas).\n• **Particular solution:** One specific curve from the family, determined by an initial condition y(x₀) = y₀.\n  Example: y(0) = 3 → C = 3 → y = x² + 3.\n\n**Equilibrium solutions** are constant solutions where dy/dx = 0 for all x.
