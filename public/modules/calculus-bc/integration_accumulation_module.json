  "description": "Master the definite integral from first principles through advanced techniques. Begin with Riemann sums and the concept of accumulation, then formalize with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (both parts). Build a toolkit of antidifferentiation methods: u-substitution for chain-rule reversal, integration by parts for products, partial fractions for rational functions, and improper integrals for unbounded domains or integrands. This heavyweight unit is the backbone of AP Calculus BC — nearly half of the exam's free-response questions require fluent integration skills.",
