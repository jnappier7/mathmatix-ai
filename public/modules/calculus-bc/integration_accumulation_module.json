Begin with Riemann sums and the concept of accumulation, then formalize with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (both parts). Build a toolkit of antidifferentiation methods: u-substitution for chain-rule reversal, integration by parts for products, partial fractions for rational functions, and improper integrals for unbounded domains or integrands. This heavyweight unit is the backbone of AP Calculus BC \u2014 nearly half of the exam's free-response questions require fluent integration skills.",
