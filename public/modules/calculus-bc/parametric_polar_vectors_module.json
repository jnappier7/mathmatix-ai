Parametric equations describe curves using a parameter t, polar coordinates replace (x, y) with (r, θ), and vector-valued functions package motion into component form. You will learn to compute derivatives, arc lengths, areas, velocities, and accelerations in all three frameworks — skills that appear in both multiple-choice and free-response sections of the BC exam.",
