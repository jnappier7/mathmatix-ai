  "description": "Infinite series form the largest and most heavily tested BC-exclusive topic, typically accounting for 25–30% of the BC exam. Starting with sequences and geometric series, you will build a toolkit of convergence tests — nth-term, integral, comparison, limit comparison, ratio, and alternating series — learning when each test is most effective. The unit culminates with Taylor and Maclaurin series, where you construct polynomial approximations of functions, determine their intervals of convergence, and bound approximation errors using the Lagrange error bound.",
