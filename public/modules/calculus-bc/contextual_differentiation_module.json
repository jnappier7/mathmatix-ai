We differentiate that equation with respect to t (time) to find how the rates are related.\n\n**The Framework (follow every time):**\n1. **Draw a diagram** and label ALL variables\n2. **Write the equation** connecting the variables\n3. **Differentiate both sides** with respect to t (implicit differentiation!)\n4. **Substitute** the known values and solve for the unknown rate\n5. **State the answer** with units and interpretation\n\n**Common setups:**\n\u2022 Pythagorean theorem: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = L\u00b2 (ladders, shadows)\n\u2022 Volume/area formulas: V = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, A = \u03c0r\u00b2, V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h\n\u2022 Similar triangles: ratios stay constant as dimensions change\n\u2022 Trigonometric: tan \u03b8 = opposite/adjacent\n\n**Critical:** Never substitute numerical values for changing variables BEFORE differentiating.
