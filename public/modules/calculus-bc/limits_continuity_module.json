Graphically:** Trace the curve from the left and right toward x = c. If both sides approach the same y-value, that's the limit.\n\n**2. Numerically (tables):** Plug in values approaching c from both sides (e.g., 2.9, 2.99, 2.999 and 3.1, 3.01, 3.001). If both columns converge to the same value, that's the limit.\n\n**3. Algebraically (direct substitution):** If f is continuous at c, just plug in: lim_{x\u2192c} f(x) = f(c). This works for polynomials, rationals (where defined), exponentials, logs, and trig functions at points in their domains.\n\n**When direct substitution gives 0/0:** This is an *indeterminate form* \u2014 NOT the answer. It means more work is needed: try factoring, rationalizing, or other algebraic manipulation.\n\n**Limit Laws (for limits that exist):**\n\u2022 lim [f(x) \u00b1 g(x)] = lim f(x) \u00b1 lim g(x)\n\u2022 lim [f(x) \u00b7 g(x)] = lim f(x) \u00b7 lim g(x)\n\u2022 lim [f(x)/g(x)] = lim f(x) / lim g(x), provided lim g(x) \u2260 0\n\u2022 lim [f(x)]\u207f = [lim f(x)]\u207f",
