  "description": "The number line expands and the coordinate plane opens up. Students use positive and negative numbers in real contexts (temperature, elevation, money, sea level), compare and order rational numbers including negatives, master absolute value as distance from zero, graph ordered pairs in all four quadrants, and calculate horizontal/vertical distances using absolute value. This unit sets up ALL graphing for 7th grade and beyond.",
