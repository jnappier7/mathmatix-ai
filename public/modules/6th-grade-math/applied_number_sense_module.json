  "description": "Everything connects here. Students tackle mixed problems combining ratios, fractions, and equations. They get a proper introduction to percent as a rate per 100 (connecting to fractions and decimals), practice unit conversions in multi-step contexts, and solve complex real-world tasks that require tables, diagrams, and multi-domain reasoning. This is the bridge to 7th-grade math — proof that students can handle complexity.",
