    "Diagnostic-first: every skill opens with a quick probe. If the student nails it, skip the reteach and move to practice. If they stumble, drop into the full explanation-model-guided cycle. Do NOT waste time reteaching what is already solid.",
    "Decimal and fraction work must be grounded in contexts these kids actually care about—money, gaming scores, recipes, sports stats. Abstract drill is the fastest way to lose an 11-year-old.",
    "Integer basics are a 6th-grade NEW concept for many students, not just review. Use the number line as the primary visual. Avoid rules-before-reasons: let them see why -3 < 2 on the line before memorizing sign rules.",
    "Multiplication and division fluency is non-negotiable. Students who still finger-count single-digit facts will drown in fraction and ratio work later. Use timed mental-math bursts, not shame—frame speed as a game, not a test.",
    "Expression writing is the bridge from arithmetic to algebra. Anchor every translation in a real scenario first ('you have x dollars and spend 5' → x - 5), then strip away the story. If a student writes '5 - x' when they mean 'x - 5,' that misconception must be caught immediately."

You already know the ones, tens, hundreds places to the LEFT of the decimal point. Now we zoom in on what lives to the RIGHT: tenths, hundredths, and thousandths.\n\nThink of it like zooming in on a ruler. One whole unit splits into 10 tenths, each tenth splits into 10 hundredths, and each hundredth splits into 10 thousandths. The pattern is always times-ten or divide-by-ten.\n\nWhen you compare decimals, line up the decimal points and read left to right—just like comparing whole numbers. When you round, look at the digit ONE place to the right of where you're rounding: 5 or more rounds up, 4 or less stays. Adding and subtracting decimals? Line up the decimal points, fill empty spots with zeros, and add or subtract as usual.",

The goal here is AUTOMATICITY—you see 6 x 9 and 54 just appears.\n\nMulti-digit multiplication uses the distributive property in disguise. When you multiply 47 x 36, you are really computing 47 x 30 + 47 x 6. The standard algorithm stacks these partial products.\n\nLong division is the reverse process: how many groups of the divisor fit into the dividend?
