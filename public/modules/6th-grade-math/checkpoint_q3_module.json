Which team performed better overall, and which team was more consistent? Use specific numbers to support your answer.",
      "answer": "Team A performed better overall because their mean score (54 points) is higher than Team B's mean (48 points), meaning they scored about 6 more points per game on average. Team A was also more consistent because their range (12 points) is much smaller than Team B's range (30 points), meaning Team A's scores varied less from game to game.",

      "answer": "Class 1 performed better overall. Their center is higher (median 16 vs. 14, mean 15 vs. 13.5), meaning the typical student in Class 1 scored about 2 points higher. Class 1 also has less variability (IQR of 4 vs. 8), meaning their scores were more clustered together. Class 2's wider IQR of 8 indicates greater spread — some students did well but others scored much lower. Class 1 had both higher typical scores and more consistent performance.",
