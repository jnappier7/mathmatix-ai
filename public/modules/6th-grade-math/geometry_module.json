      "content": "Every area formula in this unit grows out of the rectangle. A rectangle's area is length times width — that is our starting point. A parallelogram is a rectangle in disguise: if you slice off the slanted triangle on one end and slide it to the other end, you get a rectangle with the same base and height. So the area of a parallelogram is A = base x height. A triangle is exactly half of a parallelogram. Take any triangle, make a copy, flip it, and attach it — you get a parallelogram. Since the triangle is half, its area is A = 1/2 x base x height. The most important rule: the HEIGHT is always PERPENDICULAR to the base. It is NOT a slanted side. Look for the right-angle mark.",

That is AREA (painting a wall, laying tile, mowing a lawn). Am I wrapping or covering the outside of a 3D object? That is SURFACE AREA (wrapping a gift, painting a box, covering a tent). Am I filling the inside of a 3D object? That is VOLUME (filling a pool, packing a box, pouring concrete). Many real problems are multi-step: first calculate a measurement, then use it to find a cost, amount of material, or number of items needed. Always check your units and whether the answer makes sense in context.",
