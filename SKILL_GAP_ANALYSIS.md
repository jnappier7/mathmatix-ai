## Duplicate Skills to Resolve

The following skills appear in multiple files:

1. **`multiplication-basics`** - in skills-grade-3.json AND skills-pattern-based.json
2. **`combining-like-terms`** - in skills-grade-6.json, skills-ready-for-algebra.json, AND skills-pattern-based.json
3. **`distributive-property`** - in skills-grade-7.json, skills-ready-for-algebra.json, AND skills-pattern-based.json
4. **`two-step-equations`** - in skills-grade-7.json, skills-ready-for-algebra.json, AND skills-pattern-based.json
5. **`solving-multi-step-equations`** - appears twice in skills-ready-for-algebra.json
6. **`percent-basics`** - in skills-grade-6.json AND skills-ready-for-algebra.json

**Recommendation:** Keep the pattern-based versions (most recent, with pattern context in `unit` field) and remove from other files.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Create Consolidated Master File
Merge all 232 unique skills into `/seeds/skills-master.json`:
- Remove all duplicates (keep pattern-based versions)
- Organize by category or alphabetically
- Single source of truth for seeding

### Option B: Keep Separate Files, Document Dependencies
- Keep grade-level files for curriculum alignment
- Keep pattern-based file for pattern-specific skills
- Document which file "wins" for duplicates
- Update seed script to handle conflicts

### Option C: Incremental Priority-Based Addition
- Keep current structure
- Add missing skills to pattern-based file in priority order:
  1. Add 27 Tier 1 skills (Phase 1)
  2. Add 43 Tier 2 skills (Phase 2)
  3. Add 41 Tier 3 skills (Phase 3)
  4. Add 35 Tier 4 skills (Phase 4)

**Recommended:** Option A (Consolidated Master File) for clarity and maintainability.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Seed database** with consolidated skills
2. **Test each pattern** - select milestones from each tier
3. **Verify problem generation** - ensure skills load correctly
4. **Check IRT scoring** - confirm difficulty values
5. **Monitor fallback usage** - track when fallback is still needed
